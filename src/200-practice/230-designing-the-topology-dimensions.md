# Designing the Topology (Dimensions)

Once you have Orientation, the next step is to decide:

> “Which dimensions of inquiry belong in this space, and which should stay out?”

This is your **topology design**.

You are not filling in all possible lenses.  
You are choosing a **small, functional subset** that:

- fits the situation and mode,
- respects power and safety,
- and stays within scope.

This chapter gives you:

- a quick recap of dimensions,
- design principles for choosing,
- mode-based suggestions (Setup, Stabilization, Growth),
- domain-specific shortcuts (delivery/consulting, personal, music),
- and example minimal topologies you can reuse.

## Quick Recap of Dimensions

The full Theory chapter has details. Here is the compact view:

- Clarification – align meaning and concrete understanding.
- Assumptions – surface what is taken for granted.
- Boundaries & Ownership – define scope, roles, and decisions.
- Value & Impact – explore who benefits/suffers and what matters most.
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs – make the felt experience and basic needs visible enough to design responsibly.
- Contrast & Alternatives – compare options and highlight trade-offs.
- Causality & Consequence – link causes and likely effects.
- Layering / Abstraction – move between detail and system-level view.
- Temporal – look at past, present, future trajectories.
- Evidence & Uncertainty – distinguish knowledge from assumption and gauge confidence.
- Meta / Reflexive – reflect on the space and its usefulness.

You almost never need all of them at once.

## Principles for Choosing Dimensions

When designing topology, keep a few principles in mind.

### Match dimensions to mode

- Setup:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries, Value & Impact are usually core.
- Stabilization:
  - Add Emotional & Relational Field / Needs and Evidence & Uncertainty early.
- Growth:
  - Add Contrast, Temporal, Layering, and more deliberate Evidence & Uncertainty.

### Design for minimal sufficiency

- Start with the smallest set that can realistically satisfy your Orientation.
- Add only when a specific gap appears:
  - “We keep arguing about facts” → add Evidence & Uncertainty.
  - “Everyone is tired and defensive” → bring in Emotion & Needs carefully.
  - “This feels stuck in details” → add Layering.

### Respect power and safety

- Strong hierarchy or low psychological safety:
  - Emotion & Needs and Meta questions must be phrased carefully and may need lighter use.
  - Start with system-level lenses (Clarification, Boundaries, Value) before personal ones.
- Peer or high-trust contexts:
  - You can use deeper Emotion & Needs and Meta earlier.

### Stay within scope

- If a dimension invites you into therapy, legal argument, or medical judgment, you are drifting.
- Emotion & Needs stays focused on this work/creative context and near future.
- Evidence & Uncertainty stays focused on decisions and risks, not medical or legal diagnosis.

### Prefer reusable cores

Over time you will build a few **personal default topologies** per domain.  
Aim for:

- 3–5 dimensions as a default,
- plus 1–2 optional “add-ons” depending on the situation.

## Mode-Based Topology Suggestions

Use these as starting points, not rules.

### Setup Mode – Building Initial Structure

Goal: establish shared meaning, expectations, and basic boundaries before deeper commitments.

Default core:

- Clarification  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Value & Impact  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta / Reflexive (light)

Optional:

- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs (light, especially if there is history)
- Temporal (if long-term trajectory matters strongly)

Questions to decide what to include:

- “Do we already have conflicting stories about what this is?”  
  Yes → Clarification, Assumptions.
- “Do we see early signs of misaligned expectations?”  
  Yes → Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact.
- “Are big claims or estimates being thrown around?”  
  Yes → Evidence & Uncertainty.
- “Is there pre-existing tension or skepticism?”  
  Yes → at least a light Emotion & Needs check.

Example Setup topologies:

- New client–vendor engagement:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty, light Emotion & Needs, Meta.

- New internal initiative:
  - Clarification, Value & Impact, Boundaries, Temporal, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

### Stabilization Mode – Repair and Reset

Goal: repair misalignment, reduce tension, restore a workable baseline.

Core:

- Clarification  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Value & Impact  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta / Reflexive  

Optional:

- Causality & Consequence (to understand recurring patterns)
- Temporal (to map how we got here and where we are heading)

Questions to refine:

- “Are people angry, tired, or disappointed?”  
  Yes → Emotion & Needs is non-optional; just phrase it safely.
- “Are there conflicting accounts of what happened?”  
  Yes → Evidence & Uncertainty, Temporal.
- “Do we suspect structural issues (handoffs, roles)?”  
  Yes → Boundaries & Ownership, Causality & Consequence.

Example Stabilization topologies:

- Project escalation between client and vendor:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Emotion & Needs, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

- Team conflict about responsibilities:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Emotion & Needs, Causality & Consequence, Meta.

### Growth Mode – Deepening and Expanding

Goal: explore potential, refine systems, make deliberate trade-offs.

Core:

- Value & Impact  
- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Temporal  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Meta / Reflexive  

Optional:

- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs (positive focus: “how should this feel at its best?”)
- Boundaries & Ownership (for scaling and governance questions)

Questions to refine:

- “Are we deciding between multiple viable paths?”  
  Yes → Contrast & Alternatives, Value & Impact.
- “Are we thinking long-term?”  
  Yes → Temporal, Causality & Consequence.
- “Are we trying to generalize or scale?”  
  Yes → Layering (local vs systemic), Boundaries & Ownership.
- “Are we planning bets and experiments?”  
  Yes → Evidence & Uncertainty.

Example Growth topologies:

- Long-term product strategy:
  - Value & Impact, Contrast & Alternatives, Temporal, Layering, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

- Evolving band / creative direction:
  - Value & Impact, Emotion & Needs (positive), Contrast & Alternatives, Temporal, Causality & Consequence, Meta.

## Domain Shortcuts

Different domains will give you different default topologies.

### Software Delivery and Consulting

You already know typical friction points: vague value, moving scope, power imbalances, emotional fatigue, and unclear evidence.

Common default sets:

- Setup (new engagement):
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty, light Emotion & Needs, Meta.

- Stabilization (slipping project, frustrated client):
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Emotion & Needs, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

- Growth (improving delivery practice or engagement model):
  - Value & Impact, Layering, Causality & Consequence, Evidence & Uncertainty, Temporal, Meta.

When in doubt in delivery/consulting:

- Boundaries & Ownership almost always belong.
- Evidence & Uncertainty is critical for anything with timelines, cost, and performance.
- Emotion & Needs is essential when humans are tired or defensive.

### Personal Reflection and Role Decisions

Here you are both “system” and “participant”.

Common default sets:

- Reflection about staying/leaving role or project:
  - Value & Impact, Emotional & Relational Field / Needs, Temporal, Layering, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

- Reflection about learning/focus:
  - Value & Impact, Temporal, Layering, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

Notes:

- Boundaries & Ownership can be helpful when differentiating:
  - what you own,
  - what the organization owns,
  - what nobody owns.
- Emotion & Needs is often primary here, but you must still respect your own limits:
  - if it uncovers deeper trauma or severe distress, QSS is not the main tool.

### Music Production and Creative Work

Here you balance:

- artistic intent,
- technical quality,
- audience context,
- band dynamics.

Common default sets:

- Mixing direction (polish vs raw):
  - Contrast & Alternatives, Value & Impact, Emotional & Relational Field / Needs, Evidence & Uncertainty (listening contexts, references), Causality & Consequence, Meta.

- Band alignment about identity:
  - Value & Impact, Emotional & Relational Field / Needs, Contrast & Alternatives, Temporal (past gigs vs future direction), Layering (song vs set vs identity), Meta.

- Creative process refinement:
  - Causality & Consequence (what leads to good work), Temporal (how ideas evolve), Evidence & Uncertainty (what actually works for your audience), Meta.

## Power- and Safety-Aware Adjustments

Once you’ve chosen an initial set of dimensions, quickly run it through a power/safety filter.

Questions:

- “Is there a strong hierarchy here?”  
  Yes → Start with:
  - Clarification, Boundaries, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty.  
  Introduce Emotion & Needs more carefully and at system level.
- “Is someone’s job / contract at risk if they answer candidly?”  
  Yes → Avoid:
  - questions that force individuals to self-incriminate or criticize others directly in front of higher power.
  Use more:
  - system language (“our process”, “this engagement”),  
  - or anonymous/written formats for sensitive topics.
- “Is there visible distress?”  
  Yes →  
  - Keep Emotion & Needs, but within scope and present context.  
  - Avoid deep personal history.  
  - If distress is strong, pause and consider different support.

Practical adjustments:

- You can keep Emotion & Needs in topology but limit phrasing to:
  - “How does this collaboration / setup feel?” rather than “How do you feel about your life?”
- You can keep Evidence & Uncertainty but avoid aggressive cross-examination:
  - “What do we know?” instead of “Prove it.”

## Minimal Topologies You Can Reuse

Here are a few ready-made minimal sets you can plug into your own work.

### Minimal Setup – “Grounding”

- Clarification  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Value & Impact  
- Meta  

Use when:

- you start something new,
- stakes are moderate,
- power imbalance is present,
- time is tight.

### Minimal Stabilization – “Stop the Slide”

- Clarification  
- Assumptions  
- Emotion & Needs  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Value & Impact  
- Meta  

Use when:

- frustration is visible,
- you need to avoid another vague retro,
- you want one or two stabilizing moves, not a full redesign.

### Minimal Reflection – “Should I…?”

- Value & Impact  
- Emotion & Needs  
- Temporal  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta  

Use when:

- you face a personal choice,
- you want more than pros/cons,
- you do not need a full life review.

### Minimal Creative Choice – “Which Direction?”

- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Value & Impact  
- Emotion & Needs  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta  

Use when:

- multiple viable artistic/technical options exist,
- you want to tie the decision to identity and audience,
- you need to move forward without overcomplicating.

## Workflow: From Orientation to Topology

When you design topology for a specific situation:

- Start from Orientation:
  - which cognitive and relational goals are primary?
- Decide mode:
  - Setup, Stabilization, or Growth?
- Draft a small set of dimensions:
  - 3–5 core, 1–2 optional.
- Run power/safety check:
  - adjust Emotion & Needs, Meta, and Evidence usage if needed.
- Save the chosen topology in a sentence:
  - “For this situation, I’ll use Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries, Value & Impact, Emotion & Needs (light), Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.”

This becomes the input to:

- `240-designing-the-flow-and-pathways.md` – where you turn this topology into an actual conversational path.

If a space feels wrong in practice, come back to topology and ask:

- “Which dimension is missing that would make this honest?”
- “Which dimension is overused and keeping us stuck?”
- “Is there a dimension here that is too heavy or unsafe for this context?”

Adjust, name the new set, and try again.
