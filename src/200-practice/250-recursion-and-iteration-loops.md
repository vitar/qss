# Recursion and Iteration Loops

Designing a question space is not a one-shot event.

Every time you **use** a space, you are also:

- testing its assumptions,
- discovering how it behaves with real people,
- and gathering data to update it.

This chapter shows how to make that **deliberate**:

- Recursion in the moment (Meta during and after sessions).
- Iteration between sessions (small tweaks, big revisions).
- Versioning (v1, v1.1, v2) so you don’t lose your learning history.
- Building a personal library of spaces that actually fit your work.

Think of this as the **“DevEx” chapter** for your question spaces.

## What Recursion Means in Practice

In theory, Recursion is the space reflecting on itself.

In practice, that means:

- You do not just ask:
  - “What did we learn about the topic?”
- You also ask:
  - “What did we learn about how we asked?”

This happens at three levels:

- In-session Meta:
  - Mini check-ins while the space is running.
- Post-session review:
  - Right after, or same day.
- Pattern-level iteration:
  - After several uses of the same space.

You don’t have to do all three every time, but having them as **options** makes QSS a living system instead of a static toolkit.

## Level 1 – In-Session Meta

In-session Meta is the lightest form of recursion.

You embed small questions like:

- “How is this conversation landing so far?”
- “Is there anything we’re not talking about that feels important?”
- “Do we need to slow down or change direction?”

### Why this matters

- Prevents you from blindly following a script when the room is clearly somewhere else.
- Lets participants co-steer the flow.
- Surfaces safety issues before they do damage.

### Where to place Meta check-ins

Good places:

- After a shallow pass across dimensions.
- After a dense or emotional block.
- Near the end, before closure.

Avoid:

- Constant meta every few minutes (meta overload).
- Meta as a way to avoid taking a stance or getting concrete.

### Example micro Meta questions

For client–vendor / team:

- “What part of this feels most useful so far? What feels least useful?”
- “Is there anything about these questions that feels unfair or one-sided?”
- “Have we named the real issue, or are we still circling?”

For personal reflection:

- “Which answer surprised me?”
- “Which part of my thinking feels more stable? Which feels shakier?”
- “Am I avoiding something important because it’s uncomfortable?”

For band / creative:

- “Does this feel like we’re talking about the music we actually make, or some imaginary band?”
- “Is there a perspective (audience, booker, one of us) that we haven’t heard yet in this conversation?”

## Level 2 – Post-Session Review

After you run a space (or as soon as you can), you do a quick review:

> “How did this question space actually behave with real humans?”

This is where you collect **feedback** and your own **observations**.

### Minimal post-session checklist

Take 5–10 minutes and jot down:

- What went well:
  - “Which parts of the flow clearly helped?”
  - “Which questions opened something important?”
- What felt off:
  - “Where did we lose energy?”
  - “Where did people look confused, bored, or defensive?”
  - “Did any question feel unsafe, unfair, or out of scope?”
- What was missing:
  - “Was there a dimension we never touched that would have mattered?”
  - “Did we gloss over consequences, evidence, or emotions?”
- What I learned about the space:
  - “This space is good for X, weak for Y.”

You can do this as:

- a short note in your repo / notebook,
- or a simple template (see below).

### Template: “One-page space review”

You can use something like:

- Context:
  - What was the situation?
- Mode:
  - Setup / Stabilization / Growth.
- What worked:
  - Specific moments and questions.
- What didn’t:
  - Where flow or phrasing failed.
- Safety / power:
  - Any moments of visible distress or power issues?
- Evidence / uncertainty:
  - Did we confuse story with fact? Did that hurt?
- Changes I’d make:
  - Next version ideas.

This does not need to be polished. It just needs to be **honest**.

## Level 3 – Pattern-Level Iteration

After you’ve used the same space (or pattern) a few times, you step back:

> “What kind of situations is this space actually good for, and where does it fail?”

This is pattern-level recursion.

### Signals it’s time to iterate

- You keep getting similar feedback from different people.
- You personally feel a repeated friction:
  - “The emotional part always feels rushed,”
  - “We never get to decisions,”
  - “We keep arguing about facts late in the conversation.”
- The context changed:
  - new org structure,
  - new client types,
  - new band lineup,
  - new constraints (remote vs on-site).

At this point, you can:

- Distinguish:
  - “This problem is my facilitation style” vs “this problem is the space design.”
- Decide:
  - small tweaks vs new version.

### Types of changes

Common changes:

- Orientation:
  - sharpen the cognitive/relational goals,
  - explicitly name limits and power considerations.
- Topology:
  - add missing dimensions (Emotion, Evidence, Boundaries),
  - remove dimensions that never help,
  - split into variants (light vs deep).
- Flow:
  - reorder blocks,
  - insert or remove a Meta checkpoint,
  - change where Emotion & Needs appears,
  - adjust branch conditions.
- Phrasing:
  - soften or sharpen certain questions,
  - change “you” to “we/system”,
  - add “from your perspective” for multi-views.

### Versioning your spaces

Treat spaces like code:

- v1.0 – first working version.
- v1.1 – small improvements:
  - phrasing, order, a new question.
- v2.0 – significant redesign:
  - new Orientation,
  - new topology,
  - different flow,
  - or split into multiple spaces.

Keep a simple changelog:

- v1.0:
  - initial design.
- v1.1:
  - added Evidence & Uncertainty block before decisions; feedback showed we were deciding on stories.
- v2.0:
  - split “Escalation Stabilization” space into:
    - “Light Tension Check-in” and
    - “Full Reset Workshop”.

You do not need heavy tooling. A `.md` file with dates and notes is enough.

## Recursion with Emotion, Power, Evidence, Limits

Recursion is also where you keep the system **ethical**.

### Emotion and needs: did we stay within scope?

Questions after a session:

- “Did we surface enough of the emotional/relational reality to be honest?”
- “Did we drift into stuff that feels more like therapy?”
- “Did someone share something heavy that we could not responsibly hold here?”

If you see drift:

- Tighten Orientation for next time:
  - be explicit about emotional scope (present, context-bound).
- Adjust questions:
  - fewer deep personal prompts,
  - more contextual ones (“this collaboration”, “this project”, “this gig”).
- Consider separate spaces:
  - one for work/creative decisions,
  - another for personal processing with appropriate support.

### Power: did anyone pay a hidden cost?

Questions:

- “Did lower-power people speak openly, or did they freeze?”
- “Did any question feel like interrogation from above?”
- “Did my position (or the sponsor’s) make some questions unsafe?”

If yes:

- Adjust Flow:
  - start with self-accountability questions if you are in power.
- Adjust Topology:
  - keep Emotion & Needs but focus on system impact:
    - “What in our setup is draining?” rather than “What are you upset about?”
- Adjust format:
  - for sensitive topics, use:
    - smaller groups,
    - anonymous input,
    - 1:1s instead of big mixed-power sessions.

### Evidence and uncertainty: did we fool ourselves?

Questions:

- “Did we treat assumptions as facts?”
- “Did we skip Evidence & Uncertainty because it was inconvenient?”
- “Did people latch onto a narrative and ignore contradictory data?”

If yes:

- Add or move Evidence & Uncertainty earlier in the flow.
- Add explicit prompts like:
  - “What would change our mind?”
  - “What do we not know that we are acting as if we know?”
- Be honest in Orientation:
  - “We’re making decisions with high uncertainty; our goal is to make reversible bets, not perfect calls.”

### Limits: did we exceed what QSS can safely handle?

Questions:

- “Did we step into topics that really need a therapist/lawyer/doctor/HR?”
- “Did I feel out of depth in terms of responsibility?”

If yes:

- Update Orientation and your own mental guardrails:
  - state clearly what the space won’t do next time.
- Add explicit exit lines:
  - “This part sounds bigger than what we can handle here. It might be better to…”
- Learn to **stop**:
  - not every line of inquiry must be followed to the end.

## Building Your Personal Library of Spaces

Over time, you will accumulate:

- a few core spaces for:
  - client–vendor work,
  - internal leadership and team topics,
  - personal reflection,
  - music / creative decisions.

Recursion and iteration turn them into a **library tuned to your mind and contexts**.

### Simple structure for your library

Example folders:

- `spaces/`
  - `delivery/`
    - `client-setup-v1.1.md`
    - `escalation-stabilization-v2.0.md`
    - `practice-retro-v1.0.md`
  - `personal/`
    - `role-decision-v1.2.md`
    - `burnout-check-v1.0.md`
  - `music/`
    - `mix-direction-v1.1.md`
    - `band-alignment-v1.0.md`

Inside each file:

- Orientation statement.
- Topology (dimensions).
- Flow sketch.
- Notes on power/safety.
- Version history.

You can start small:

- One “client setup” space.
- One “project stabilization” space.
- One “role decision” space.
- One “mix direction” space.

Use, tweak, version.

### Using recursion to tune for your style

Because QSS is **personal**, recursion will slowly reveal:

- your tendencies:
  - dimensions you overuse (Clarification? Value?),
  - dimensions you underuse (Emotion? Evidence? Boundaries?).
- your comfort zone:
  - where you easily go deep,
  - where you get uncomfortable (power, emotion, uncertainty).
- your signatures:
  - patterns that people find uniquely helpful in your spaces.

You can explicitly ask:

- “Which parts of my question spaces do people repeatedly appreciate?”
- “Where do they flinch, disengage, or feel exhausted?”

Then shift:

- lean into your strengths,
- patch the weak spots with small design changes.

## Lightweight Recursion Habits

To make all this sustainable, keep it light:

- One Meta check-in per session:
  - “What felt useful / not useful?”
- One 5-minute notes file after significant sessions.
- One small change per iteration:
  - don’t refactor everything every time.
- One monthly review:
  - “Which spaces did I use? How did they perform? What pattern changes do I want?”

You’re not trying to “optimize conversation” as a perfectionist project.  
You’re building a **living craft**: question spaces that grow with you, your work, and your relationships.

## When to Stop Iterating

Sometimes, the right recursion move is to **stop** working on a space:

- It was designed for a context that no longer exists.
- It consistently produces stress or confusion despite multiple attempts.
- You’ve outgrown it; your mental models are now different.

In that case:

- Archive it:
  - keep it as historical artifact.
- Note:
  - what it taught you,
  - what you’d never do that way again.
- Move on to a new version or a new pattern.

Not every space needs to be “maintained” forever.  
Some are stepping stones; their value was in getting you to the next one.

Recursion and iteration loops are how QSS stays:

- humane,
- power-aware,
- evidence-aware,
- and actually useful in your real situations.

Every time you run a question space, you are not just solving a problem.  
You are also training your own **Question Space System** to become sharper, safer, and more you.
