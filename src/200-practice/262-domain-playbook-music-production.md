# Domain Playbook: Music Production and Creative Decisions

This playbook shows how to turn QSS into concrete question spaces for:

- mixing and mastering decisions,
- live vs studio aesthetics,
- band alignment on sound and identity,
- planning creative work (recordings, releases, sets).

It is written with modern DAWs, plugins, and live recordings in mind, but the patterns work for any genre or setup.

You can:

- use these spaces directly for real sessions, or
- treat them as scaffolding to design your own.

## How to use this playbook

For each situation you’ll see:

- Orientation – what the space is for and what it is not for.
- Suggested topology – which dimensions to activate.
- Flow sketch – practical sequences with example prompts.
- Notes on power, safety, and limits – especially around band dynamics and health.

Typical use-cases:

- “Should this live album be raw or polished?”
- “Why does this mix still feel wrong?”
- “What sound are we actually aiming for as a band?”
- “Which songs or ideas should we prioritize?”

You’re expected to adapt phrasing to your band’s language and your own style.

## Situation: Mixing Direction – Raw Live vs Polished Studio

Goal: choose a coherent direction for a mix or master that fits the band’s identity and audience, instead of endlessly tweaking between extremes.

### Orientation

“In this Growth-mode creative situation, with band members and/or producer deciding on the direction of a mix or master,  
I want this question space to help us choose a sound between ‘raw live’ and ‘polished studio’ that fits our identity, audience, and medium,  
in a way that feels collaborative and honest,  
within a 45–90 minute listening and discussion session, staying within creative and practical constraints and not turning into a debate about personal worth.”

### Suggested topology

- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Value & Impact  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

You can run this in rehearsal space or online; ideally while listening to reference tracks and your own work.

**Step 1 – Contrast the extremes**

- “If we go fully ‘raw live’, what does that sound like?”  
  Talk about:
  - crowd noise,
  - mistakes left in,
  - dynamics,  
  - stereo width,
  - ambience.
- “If we go fully ‘polished studio’, what does that sound like?”  
  Talk about:
  - tight editing,
  - sample-replaced drums,
  - heavy tuning,
  - loudness,
  - effects.

Then ask:

- “In one sentence, what is the main promise of each extreme to us and to listeners?”

**Step 2 – Value & Impact**

- “What do we most want listeners to feel when they hear this record?”  
  Examples: “like they’re in the front row”, “like a finished album”, “like a cinematic experience”.
- “What matters more for us here:
  - translation on any system,
  - preserving the gig’s energy and imperfections,
  - showcasing musicianship and sound quality,
  - something else?”
- “Whose opinion matters most: our own, existing fans, potential new listeners, promoters, festivals, reviewers?”

If people disagree, note tensions explicitly.

**Step 3 – Emotional & Needs check**

- “When you listen to the rawer version, how do you feel?”  
  Examples: proud, exposed, anxious, excited, nostalgic.
- “When you listen to a more polished version, how do you feel?”  
  Examples: safer, bored, impressed, disconnected.
- “What personal needs are active for you here?”  
  Examples: authenticity, pride, perfection, recognition, risk, play, safety.

Keep this about the music and current project, not full life stories.

**Step 4 – Causality & Consequence**

- “If we commit to a more raw direction, what happens next?”  
  Examples:
  - easier to reproduce live,
  - mistakes become part of the story,
  - some listeners might struggle on phone speakers,
  - bookers get a realistic picture.
- “If we commit to a more polished direction, what happens?”  
  Examples:
  - expectations for live performance rise,
  - more work in editing and mixing,
  - possibly better fit for playlists and some reviewers,
  - risk of losing ‘sweat’ and chaos.

- “Which consequences are we okay owning, and which feel too risky?”

**Step 5 – Evidence & Uncertainty**

- “What do we actually know from:
  - previous releases,
  - live feedback,
  - comments,
  - or streams
  about what our audience responds to?”
- “What are we assuming?”  
  Examples:
  - “People hate mistakes”,
  - “No one cares about dynamics”,
  - “Promoters only listen to polished stuff.”
- “How could we test any of this?”  
  Examples:
  - two different mixes of one track for trusted listeners,
  - A/B listening with small groups,
  - private links with different versions.

**Step 6 – Layering – song, show, identity**

- “At the song level, which songs want more polish, and which want more rawness?”
- “At the show/album level, what arc do we want?”  
  For example:
  - start more polished, end wilder; or the opposite.
- “At the identity level, what do we want people to say about our sound?”  
  One sentence each.

**Step 7 – Decision and Meta**

- “Based on this, where on the raw ↔ polished spectrum do we want to land for this project?”  
  You can pick:
  - a general direction (“70% live, 30% polish”),
  - or specific rules (“keep crowd and count-ins, fix only painful mistakes”).
- “What guidelines do we agree on for:
  - editing,
  - tuning,
  - compression,
  - ambience,
  - loudness?”
- “What did this conversation surface that we want to remember for future records?”

### Power, safety, limits

- Power: if one person owns the DAW/mix, name their role clearly to avoid hidden power (“I have the project file, but we decide together.”).
- Safety: if someone feels deeply ashamed of specific parts of their performance, note that and treat those spots with extra care—this may require separate conversations.
- Limits: when mixing decisions touch health (for example, tinnitus, listening fatigue at high levels), QSS helps clarify intentions; medical decisions belong to health professionals.

## Situation: “The Mix Still Feels Wrong” – Diagnostic Space

Goal: when a mix is technically “fine” but emotionally or functionally off, you want a structured way to figure out why, instead of endless tweaking.

### Orientation

“In this Stabilization/Growth creative situation, where a mix is close but not satisfying,  
I want this question space to help me diagnose what feels wrong in terms of emotion, translation, and function,  
in a way that is specific and actionable rather than self-blaming,  
within a 30–60 minute listening and note-taking session, staying within the scope of this project and not judging my entire skill.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Value & Impact  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

This can be solo or with band/producer.

**Step 1 – Clarify the complaint**

- “When I say ‘this mix feels wrong’, what do I actually mean?”  
  Examples: flat, harsh, too crowded, lifeless, disconnected from performance.
- “Which moments or sections feel especially wrong?”  
  Note timestamps.

**Step 2 – Emotional field**

Listen once without touching anything.

- “As I listen, what do I feel in each section?”  
  You can jot down one word per section.
- “Does this feeling match what I want listeners to feel here?”  
- “Is the problem more:
  - emotional (vibe, intensity, narrative),
  - technical (frequency balance, dynamics, stereo),
  - or functional (translation, clarity of parts)?”

**Step 3 – Value & Impact**

- “What is this song or piece supposed to do?”  
  Examples: make people move, make them nostalgic, create tension, show technical skill.
- “Who is the primary target listener and listening context?”  
  Examples: phone with earbuds, car, hi-fi, club, YouTube live.
- “Given that, what matters most:
  - intelligibility of vocal,
  - groove and low end,
  - width/space,
  - emotional arcs?”

**Step 4 – Layering – performance vs mix vs master**

- “Is the issue really the mix, or:
  - performance,
  - arrangement,
  - editing,
  - sound design?”
- “If I could magically fix just *one layer* (performance, arrangement, mix, master, medium), which would change my feeling the most?”

This prevents you from trying to solve performance issues with EQ alone.

**Step 5 – Causality & Consequence**

For each problem moment:

- “What is causing the discomfort here?”  
  Try to guess:
  - frequency buildup,
  - transient clutter,
  - timing conflict,
  - dynamic flattening,
  - conflicting reverbs,
  - wrong emphasis (wrong instrument too loud).
- “What happens if I:
  - mute this element,
  - automate this,
  - change sidechain or EQ on this?”  
  Think in cause → effect chains.

You can note hypotheses without implementing them immediately.

**Step 6 – Evidence & Uncertainty**

- “What do I know from references in a similar style about:
  - low end balance,
  - vocal level,
  - snare brightness,
  - overall loudness?”
- “Where am I guessing based on fear (‘people won’t hear the bass’) or habit (‘I always compress like this’)?”
- “What tests could I run:
  - different monitoring levels,
  - mono check,
  - small speakers vs headphones,
  - quick reference A/B?”

**Step 7 – Meta and action**

- “What patterns do I see across all the ‘wrong’ moments?”  
  For example:
  - vocal buried during choruses,
  - cymbals too bright,
  - low end uncontrolled.
- “What are the top three changes I will try first?”  
  Keep it small:
  - one move on tone,
  - one on dynamics/space,
  - one on balance.
- “When will I stop changing this mix?”  
  Define a stopping condition:
  - a number of iterations,
  - or a set of listening tests.

### Power, safety, limits

- Power: if more than one musician is present, be careful not to turn this into “this track is ruining everything” directed at a person.
- Safety: separate “this part of the mix doesn’t work” from “you are bad” remarks; keep feedback about the sound, not the identity.
- Limits: if you’re repeatedly blocked by monitoring, room, or gear limitations, this is a technical constraint; QSS helps you see it, but solving it may require investment or new environments.

## Situation: Band Alignment on Sound and Identity

Goal: avoid each band member holding a different mental model of “our sound” and “who we are”, which leads to endless friction in mixing, setlists, artwork, and gigs.

### Orientation

“In this Setup/Growth band situation, with members having different references and expectations about our sound and identity,  
I want this question space to help us build a shared picture of who we are sonically and what we want to be known for,  
in a way that respects each member’s perspective,  
within a 60–90 minute conversation, staying within band/creative identity and not judging people’s personalities or worth.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Value & Impact  
- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Temporal  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Step 1 – Clarification: how each person sees the band**

Each member answers:

- “In one sentence, how would you describe our band to someone who never heard us?”  
- “What other artists or records feel closest to what we’re trying to do (even if we don’t sound like them yet)?”

Collect answers without critique. Then roughly summarize similarities and differences.

**Step 2 – Value & Impact**

- “What do we want to give our audience?”  
  Examples: escape, catharsis, nostalgia, community feeling, surprise, intense physical energy.
- “How do we want people to feel at:
  - a live show,
  - listening to a record alone?”
- “What do we, personally, want to get from this band?”  
  Examples: fun, mastery, visibility, income, stability, experimentation.

Highlight points of strong alignment and strong divergence.

**Step 3 – Contrast & Alternatives – possible identities**

- “If we had to choose between being known more as:
  - a precise, tight band,
  - a wild live band,
  - a ‘vibe’ band,
  - a ‘sound’ band (production-focused),
  which do we lean toward?”
- “Which directions are absolutely ‘no’ for us?”  
  Examples: “We don’t want to sound like a wedding band,” “We don’t want to be a tribute act.”
- “Is there a hybrid identity that feels true?”

**Step 4 – Emotional & Needs**

- “Which aspects of our current sound make you proud?”  
- “Which aspects secretly embarrass or frustrate you?”  
- “What do you personally need more of to feel aligned?  
  Examples: clarity about parts, more rehearsal, more experimentation, more or less polish.

Keep this about sound and working style. If deeper personal conflicts surface, note them, but don’t try to resolve everything in one session.

**Step 5 – Layering – song, set, band, story**

- “At the song level: what range of sounds are we comfortable with?”  
  For example:
  - some songs cleaner, some heavier, some more electronic.
- “At the set/album level: what arc do we want?”  
  Examples:
  - start tight, end messy;  
  - start melodic, end aggressive.
- “At the narrative level: what story are we telling about ourselves?”  
  One sentence each, then agree on a shared version or at least shared themes.

**Step 6 – Temporal**

- Past:
  - “Looking back, when did we sound most like ourselves?”  
- Present:
  - “What feels most ‘us’ in our current set or recordings?”  
- Future:
  - “In three years, if things go well, how will our sound have evolved?”  
  For example:
  - more originals, more daring arrangements, better sonics, different tuning.

**Step 7 – Meta and next decisions**

- “What feels clearer now about our sound and identity?”  
- “What decisions do we want this to influence?”
  - mixing choices,
  - setlist construction,
  - gear upgrades,
  - visual identity.
- “What is one concrete change we will test in:
  - the next rehearsal,
  - the next gig,
  - the next recording?”

### Power, safety, limits

- Power: singers, main songwriters, or band leaders often hold informal power. They should explicitly invite other voices and avoid dominating the narrative.
- Safety: if conflicts are deep (respect, fairness, money, control), those may require separate conversations; keep this space focused on sound/identity, not full relational therapy.
- Limits: if someone consistently wants a fundamentally different band, QSS can make that visible, but it cannot solve irreconcilable visions alone.

## Situation: Selecting and Prioritizing Ideas (Songs, Arrangements, Projects)

Goal: decide which musical ideas or projects to prioritize without only relying on loudest voices, recency, or random mood.

### Orientation

“In this Setup/Growth creative situation, where we have more ideas than we can execute (songs, arrangements, projects),  
I want this question space to help us prioritize what to work on next based on fit with our identity, constraints, and impact,  
in a way that feels fair and forward-moving,  
within a 45–60 minute session, staying in the creative/project domain and not turning into a referendum on anyone’s talent.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Value & Impact  
- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Step 1 – Clarify the option set**

- “List the songs/projects currently on the table.”  
  You can group by:
  - originals vs covers,
  - new vs old,
  - demos vs ready-to-record.
- “Is anything missing that someone feels strongly about including?”

**Step 2 – Value & Impact criteria**

- “What are we optimizing for in the next phase?”  
  Examples:
  - a strong live set,
  - a cohesive EP,
  - a diverse setlist for a specific gig,
  - showreel for promoters.
- “Given that, what criteria matter most?”  
  Examples:
  - audience response,
  - uniqueness,
  - technical feasibility,
  - alignment with desired identity,
  - personal excitement.

Narrow to three or four criteria.

**Step 3 – Quick contrast of options**

For each song/project (lightly):

- “How does this option score on our criteria (low/medium/high, or 1–5)?”  
- “Is there any option that clearly doesn’t fit our current focus, even if we love it?”

You don’t need perfect scoring; you just want relative clarity.

**Step 4 – Evidence & Uncertainty**

- “What do we know (from gigs, rehearsals, reactions) about each option?”  
- “Where are we guessing based on personal taste only?”
- “Is there any cheap way to test a song/project before fully committing?”  
  Examples:
  - try it in rehearsal,
  - play it once live,
  - record a rough demo.

**Step 5 – Boundaries & Ownership**

- “Who will own moving each selected option forward?”  
  Examples:
  - arrangement, lyrics, pre-production, recording, logistics.
- “How many things can we realistically carry in parallel without burning out?”
- “Are there any ‘sacred cows’ that one person keeps pushing but others don’t believe in?”  
  If so, name that gently and decide how to handle it (park, side project, or explicit experiment).

**Step 6 – Decision and Meta**

- “Given all this, which one to three songs/projects do we commit to prioritize next?”
- “What will we *not* work on in the next period, even if it’s tempting?”
- “Does anyone feel silently unhappy with this selection?”  
  If yes, hear them out briefly.
- “What felt fair or unfair about how we chose? How do we want to adjust the process next time?”

### Power, safety, limits

- Power: songwriters may feel more attached to certain pieces; name that so others understand emotional stakes.
- Safety: be careful when saying “this song isn’t strong enough”—keep it about fit and timing, not the person.
- Limits: if the band is fundamentally misaligned on what type of material to play, this will surface here; resolving that may require revisiting the identity space.

## Using and Extending This Playbook

You can now create a small “music-qss” library with spaces such as:

- `mix-direction-v1.0.md`
- `mix-diagnostic-v1.0.md`
- `band-identity-v1.0.md`
- `idea-prioritization-v1.0.md`

After each real use:

- jot down:
  - what worked,
  - what felt awkward,
  - what was missing,
- then:
  - tweak,
  - version (v1.1, v2.0),
  - and keep building a set of spaces tuned to your band and your ears.

Remember the boundaries:

- When issues touch health (hearing, physical strain), law (contracts, rights), or deep personal trauma,  
  QSS can help you see the shape of the problem,  
  but the actual solution belongs with doctors, lawyers, or therapists.

The goal of these spaces is simple:

> to help you and your collaborators make musical and production decisions that are more aligned, less random, and more honest about what you actually want to create and share.
