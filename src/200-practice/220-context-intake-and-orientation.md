# Context Intake and Orientation

Before you build any question space, you need to understand:

- What situation you are stepping into.
- Who is involved and who is affected.
- How safe it is to ask certain kinds of questions.
- What this space is actually for.

This chapter turns that into a **minimal but deliberate intake process**.

You can use it as:

- A checklist before designing a new space.
- A quick diagnostic when an existing space feels “off”.
- A shared framing tool for group work (client–vendor, team, band).

## Why Orientation Comes First

A question space is not just “good questions”.  
It is an intervention in a real system with:

- people,
- power,
- history,
- constraints,
- and consequences.

If Orientation is fuzzy, you will:

- choose the wrong dimensions,
- design flows that feel unsafe or irrelevant,
- drift into areas that are outside your role or scope,
- or create good insights that nobody can actually use.

Good intake makes your later design choices **conscious** instead of accidental.

## The Intake Skeleton

Every context intake can follow the same skeleton:

1. Situation snapshot  
2. Mode assessment (Setup, Stabilization, Growth)  
3. Stakeholders and power map  
4. Safety and scope check  
5. Intent and outcomes  
6. Constraints (time, format, language)  
7. Draft Orientation statement

The rest of this chapter walks through each step with examples and prompts.

You can do this in your head in 2–5 minutes for small situations, or write it down for bigger ones.

## Step 1 – Situation Snapshot

Start by answering very simply:

- What is happening?
- Where is it happening?
- Who is directly involved?

Useful prompts:

- “What is the event or context?”  
  Examples:
  - “New fixed-bid project with tight deadline.”
  - “Escalation about missed milestones.”
  - “1:1 with tech lead about burnout.”
  - “Decision about mixing direction for live album.”
- “What is the rough timeline?”  
  - Is this urgent? Chronic? New?
- “What has already been tried?”  
  - Past attempts at alignment, retro, escalation, etc.

Keep it short. One small paragraph is enough.

Example:

- “Vendor team and client product owner are misaligned about scope and delivery pace on a fixed-bid project. Two status calls ended in frustration. Vendor leadership asked me to ‘fix communication’ before escalation reaches C-level.”

## Step 2 – Mode Assessment

Decide which mode you are in:

- Setup:  
  before things go wrong; structuring a new collaboration, role, or decision.
- Stabilization:  
  things are wobbly, tense, confusing, or slipping.
- Growth:  
  things basically work; you want to deepen, generalize, explore potential.

Quick questions:

- “Are we mostly trying to prevent a bad outcome, stop a slide, or design a better future?”
- “Is the dominant energy: hope, confusion, or frustration?”
- “If we do nothing, do we expect immediate harm, slow erosion, or mostly missed opportunities?”

Examples:

- New client kickoff → Setup.  
- Project slipping with complaints → Stabilization.  
- Mature band planning next creative direction → Growth.

You do not need precision. You just need a **dominant mode** to guide design.

## Step 3 – Stakeholders and Power Map

Name the key people and groups:

- Who is inside the conversation?
- Who is outside but strongly affected?
- Who has more formal power and influence?
- Who carries more risk (job, contract, reputation, visa, income)?

Prompts:

- “List the roles, not just the names.”  
  For example:
  - client sponsor, product owner, vendor PM, vendor tech lead, dev team, users, band members, FOH engineer, audience.
- “For each, ask: power and risk.”

Simple grid in your head or notes:

- Higher power, lower risk:
  - client sponsor, executive, manager.
- Lower power, higher risk:
  - vendor team, ICs, juniors, contractors, freelancers.
- Mixed:
  - PMs, tech leads, band leaders, producers.

This matters because:

- It shapes which dimensions you can safely activate.
- It changes how you phrase Emotion & Needs questions.
- It changes whether certain questions feel like curiosity or interrogation.

Example:

- “Client PO has power over scope acceptance and commercial relationship. Vendor devs have low power but high risk if project is labeled ‘failure’. Vendor PM has medium formal power but high responsibility.”

## Step 4 – Safety and Scope Check

Ask yourself:

- “Is this the kind of situation QSS is meant for?”

QSS is for:

- Reflection, sense-making, alignment, decision support.
- Non-emergency work and life contexts.

QSS is not for:

- Immediate crises with risk of harm or self-harm.
- Legal decisions and disputes.
- Medical diagnosis or treatment.
- Deep therapeutic processing of trauma.

Red flag prompts:

- “Is anyone in immediate danger or at risk of self-harm?”  
- “Is this primarily a legal or medical issue?”  
- “Is someone showing severe distress that goes beyond this context?”  
- “Am I being asked to judge or treat something I am not qualified for?”

If any are yes:

- Do not proceed as if a question space is the main tool.
- Instead:
  - Acknowledge what you see (“this sounds heavier than what this context can hold”).
  - Suggest appropriate support (manager, HR, trusted person, professional, doctor, lawyer).
  - Use only very light, supportive questions if at all.

If scope is OK:

- Note any safety tension:
  - “Strong power gap between client sponsor and vendor team.”
  - “Burnout signals but not acute crisis.”
  - “Band conflict is emotional but not abusive.”

These will inform how far you go with Emotion & Needs, Meta, and evidence challenges.

## Step 5 – Intent and Outcomes

Now answer:

- “What is this space for in this specific situation?”
- “What would count as a good outcome for this session or space?”

Separate:

- Cognitive goals:
  - clarity, mapping, decision, hypothesis.
- Relational goals:
  - tone, trust, predictability, fairness, energy.

Prompts:

- “By the end of this conversation/space, I want us to have…”  
  Examples:
  - “a shared picture of the problem and constraints,”
  - “a small set of concrete stabilizing actions,”
  - “a clearer sense of which option fits my values and energy,”
  - “a deliberate artistic choice we stand behind.”

- “Relationally, I want this to feel…”  
  Examples:
  - “honest but not brutal,”
  - “direct but safe,”
  - “exploratory, not judged,”
  - “grounded and practical.”

Avoid trying to accomplish everything. Choose one or two realistic outcomes.

Examples:

- “Understand why our timelines keep slipping and agree on one change we all commit to for the next two sprints, in a way that keeps the client and team relationship workable.”
- “Clarify my own reasons for staying or leaving this role, separating fear from values, without deciding today.”
- “Decide whether this mix should lean toward raw live energy or polished audiophile sound, aligned with band identity and audience context.”

## Step 6 – Constraints

Name practical constraints that will shape design:

- Time:
  - “We have 30 minutes,” “60 minutes,” “two hours workshop,” “solo 20-minute reflection.”
- Format:
  - in-person, remote, async, written questionnaire.
- Language and culture:
  - different native languages, cultural expectations of directness.
- Recording and privacy:
  - notes only, recording, anonymous input, visible board, etc.

Prompts:

- “Given our time, which mode and depth are realistic?”
- “Does the format affect safety or honesty?”
  - Chat vs video vs in-person vs anonymous form.
- “Is anything being recorded that might change what people will say?”

Example:

- “One-hour remote call with client sponsor and vendor PM. Recording on. English as second language for both. Stakes are high (contract, reputation).”

This will affect:

- how fast you need to move (Quickstart vs deeper space),
- how emotional you can safely get,
- how you phrase questions.

## Step 7 – Draft Orientation Statement

Now combine:

- situation,
- mode,
- power/safety,
- intent,
- constraints

into a short Orientation statement.

Template:

> “In this [mode] situation, with [these people and power dynamics],  
> I want this question space to help us [cognitive goal] in a way that feels [relational goal],  
> within [time/format constraints], while staying within scope (no [out-of-scope areas]).”

Examples:

Client–vendor stabilization:

> “In this stabilization situation, with a client sponsor who holds commercial power and a vendor team under delivery pressure,  
> I want this question space to help us understand why timelines keep slipping and agree on one stabilizing change for the next two sprints,  
> in a way that feels honest but not blaming,  
> within a 60-minute remote call, while staying within work context and not drifting into personal therapy or legal argument.”

Personal role reflection:

> “In this personal reflection situation, where I alone hold decision power but am affected by organizational politics,  
> I want this space to help me clarify whether this new role fits my values, energy, and desired impact over the next 2–3 years,  
> in a way that feels honest and kind to myself,  
> within a 30-minute written reflection, staying within career/work context and not trying to resolve all past life history.”

Music production:

> “In this Growth-mode creative decision, with equal power between band members but strong emotions about identity,  
> I want this question space to help us choose between a raw live mix and a more polished sound that fits our band’s identity and audience,  
> in a way that feels respectful and collaborative,  
> within a 45-minute rehearsal discussion, staying within creative and practical constraints and not turning into a debate about personal worth.”

You do not need perfect wording. The purpose is to:

- give you a clear mental anchor,
- and later explain to others what the space is trying to do.

## Using Orientation with Others

You can share Orientation explicitly or partially, depending on context and power.

Options:

- Full transparency:
  - “My goal for this session is to understand how we got here, agree on one stabilizing change, and keep this respectful for both sides.”
- Partial:
  - Emphasize cognitive and relational goals, keep the power analysis internal.
- Private:
  - In some cases (for example, coaching yourself in a company context), you keep the full Orientation to yourself but still design based on it.

Rule of thumb:

- The more power you have, the more transparency helps.
- The less power you have, the more you may need to keep some analysis internal for safety.

## Outputs of Intake and Orientation

After this chapter, you should have:

- A short written or mental snapshot of:
  - the situation,
  - the dominant mode,
  - stakeholders and power,
  - safety/scope constraints,
  - intent and outcomes,
  - basic constraints.
- A one- or two-sentence Orientation statement.

These are the **inputs** to:

- `230-designing-the-topology-dimensions.md`:
  - choosing which dimensions to activate and which to avoid.
- `240-designing-flow-and-pathways.md`:
  - ordering questions and controlling depth.
- `250-recursion-and-iteration-loops.md`:
  - later evaluating whether your Orientation was accurate or needs revision.

If a question space feels wrong in use, you can return here and ask:

- “Did I misread the mode?”
- “Did I ignore power or safety?”
- “Was my intent too vague or too ambitious?”
- “Did I try to do therapy, legal work, or crisis management with a question space?”

Almost always, fixing Orientation fixes the rest.
