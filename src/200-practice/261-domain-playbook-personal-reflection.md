# Domain Playbook: Personal Reflection

This playbook shows how to turn QSS into concrete question spaces for:

- career and role decisions,
- energy and burnout checks,
- direction and identity questions,
- processing recurring tensions (without turning into therapy).

It is not a life-coaching manual.  
It is a set of **light but sharp spaces** you can walk yourself through, or use with a trusted partner/mentor.

You can:

- use them as written,
- or treat them as scaffolding and adapt to your style.

## How to use this playbook

For each situation you’ll see:

- Orientation – what the space is for and what it is not for.
- Suggested topology – which dimensions to activate.
- Flow sketch – a practical path with example prompts.
- Safety and limits – where to stop and redirect to other forms of support.

Typical use-cases:

- “Should I stay or move on?” questions.
- “Why am I so tired?” questions.
- “Is this still my path?” questions.
- “Why is this conflict repeating?” questions.

You are expected to write in your own notebook, note app, or simply think aloud.  
Phrasing can be changed to your own language.

## Situation: Role / Path Decision (“Should I stay, move, or pivot?”)

Goal: move beyond noisy pros/cons lists and understand how a role or path fits your values, needs, and realities.

### Orientation

“In this personal reflection situation, where I hold decision power but am affected by organizational politics, relationships, and money,  
I want this question space to help me clarify whether this role/path fits my values, needs, energy, and desired impact over the next few years,  
in a way that is honest and kind to myself,  
within a 30–60 minute written reflection, staying within career/work context and not trying to resolve deeper life history or trauma.”

### Suggested topology

- Value & Impact  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Temporal  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Boundaries & Ownership (light)  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

You can do this as journaling or talking aloud.

**Step 1 – Value and impact**

- “What do I want my work to give me in the next two to three years?”  
  Consider: learning, autonomy, money, stability, creativity, influence, calm, community.
- “Whose lives do I want my work to touch, and how?”  
- “If I imagine my future self looking back, what would they say this period was about?”

Write freely, then highlight the three most important themes.

**Step 2 – Emotion and needs in the current role**

- “On most weeks, does this role feel more energizing or more draining? Where, specifically?”
- “Which of my needs are clearly met here?”  
  Examples: safety, respect, belonging, challenge, creativity, mastery, meaning, autonomy.
- “Which needs are unmet or repeatedly violated?”
- “If nothing changes for the next twelve months, how do I realistically expect to feel?”

You do not have to fix anything here; just name it.

**Step 3 – Temporal view**

Past:

- “When in the last five years did I feel most ‘in the right place’ in my work?”  
- “What was true then about context, people, tasks, impact?”

Future:

- “If I stay in this role/path for the next two to three years and things go reasonably well, what is true?”  
- “If they go badly, what is the plausible ‘bad case’?”  
- “If I change path (new role, company, focus), what is the best plausible case and worst plausible case?”

You are not predicting; you are mapping plausible futures.

**Step 4 – Evidence and uncertainty**

- “What do I actually know about these options from concrete experience or trustworthy sources?”  
- “What am I assuming about them?”  
  Examples:
  - “New role = more recognition,”
  - “Staying = stagnation,”
  - “Consulting = freedom.”
- “How could I be wrong about each assumption?”  
- “What small experiment or conversation could reduce my uncertainty?”  
  Examples:
  - talking to someone in that role,
  - testing freelance/consulting in a small way,
  - asking for a trial change in responsibilities.

**Step 5 – Layering and boundaries**

- “How does this decision affect me personally, my close relationships, and my longer-term direction?”
- “What do I own in this situation?”  
  Examples: how I use my time, which conversations I initiate, what boundaries I set.
- “What does my organization own?”  
  Examples: structure, culture, compensation policies.
- “What does nobody own that I may be trying to control?”

Recognize where effort is possible and where it is not.

**Step 6 – Meta and next step**

- “After answering these questions, what feels more stable in my thinking?”  
- “What still feels foggy or emotionally charged?”
- “What is one small, low-risk step I will take in the next week that respects what I learned here?”  
  Examples: schedule a conversation, block time for exploration, prototype a change.

### Safety and limits

- If this reflection surfaces intense despair, self-harm thoughts, or deep trauma unrelated to the current role:
  - QSS is not the main tool.  
  - Consider talking to a professional or someone you trust.
- If money or visa risk is extreme:
  - be explicit with yourself:
    - “This decision has survival stakes; I may need a more conservative stepwise plan.”

## Situation: Energy and Burnout Check (“Why am I this tired?”)

Goal: understand whether you are dealing with overload, misalignment, or something deeper; identify levers you can realistically move.

### Orientation

“In this Stabilization-mode personal situation, where I feel unusual tiredness or cynicism about work,  
I want this question space to help me map what is draining and what is nourishing in my current setup,  
in a way that is gentle but honest,  
within a 20–40 minute reflection, staying within work/creative context and not diagnosing medical or clinical conditions.”

### Suggested topology

- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Value & Impact  
- Temporal  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Step 1 – Emotional field snapshot**

- “Right now, when I think about my work and commitments, what three words describe how I feel?”  
- “Where in my body do I feel that most (head, chest, stomach, shoulders, elsewhere)?”  
  This is just noticing; no need to analyze.

**Step 2 – Drains and sources**

- “What activities, people, and contexts are draining me the most?”  
  Write a short list.
- “What activities, people, and contexts give me energy or a sense of meaning, even if they are hard?”
- “Over the last two weeks, how much of my time has gone to drains vs sources?”

Highlight patterns rather than isolated events.

**Step 3 – Value alignment**

- “Which of my core values feel expressed in my current work?”  
  Examples: craftsmanship, learning, fairness, autonomy, collaboration, creativity.
- “Which values feel regularly compromised or ignored?”
- “Am I tired mainly because I am overextended, or also because I’m working against my values?”

**Step 4 – Temporal and causality**

- “When did this tiredness start becoming noticeable?”  
- “What changed around that time?”  
  Examples: new manager, new project, home situation, health changes, pandemic, relocation.
- “What is the most plausible chain of causes contributing to how I feel now?”

You are looking for plausible contributors, not a single root cause.

**Step 5 – Evidence and uncertainty**

- “What do I know about my physical and mental health from actual checks or professional input?”  
- “What am I assuming (for example, ‘it’s just stress’, ‘it will pass’) that might be wrong?”
- “Are there any medical or psychological red flags that I should not ignore?”  
  Examples: significant sleep changes, inability to feel joy in anything, intrusive thoughts, physical symptoms.

If you see red flags:

- QSS is not a diagnostic tool.
- Consider consulting a doctor or mental health professional.

**Step 6 – Boundaries and ownership**

- “What am I saying ‘yes’ to that I could realistically say ‘no’ or ‘not now’ to?”  
- “Where am I taking responsibility for things that are not mine to carry?”  
- “Is there any boundary I could test in the next two weeks to protect my energy?”  
  Examples: time windows, communication channels, types of work, social commitments.

**Step 7 – Meta and small adjustments**

- “What feels clearer about why I’m tired?”  
- “What is one small change I am willing to try to see if it helps?”  
  Examples: shift one recurring meeting, protect a block of focus, restart a creative habit, say no to a category of tasks.

### Safety and limits

- If you suspect burnout, depression, or other serious conditions:
  - treat this reflection as a **signal**, not a self-diagnosis.
  - Professional help is more appropriate than deeper questioning alone.
- If your main blocker is structural (for example, toxic culture, abusive behavior):
  - QSS can help you see it more clearly,
  - but change may require organizational support, HR, or exit plans.

## Situation: Identity and Direction (“Is this still my path?”)

Goal: step back from local tasks and ask whether your current direction matches who you are becoming.

### Orientation

“In this Growth-mode personal situation, where my work and identity feel out of sync or in transition,  
I want this question space to help me see how my current direction aligns with my evolving values, abilities, and desired impact,  
in a way that is exploratory and non-judgmental,  
within a 45–60 minute reflection, staying within life/work direction and not trying to rewrite my entire life story.”

### Suggested topology

- Value & Impact  
- Temporal  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Step 1 – Values and desired impact now**

- “What do I care about more today than I did five years ago?”  
- “What do I care about less today than I did five years ago?”  
- “If I could direct most of my energy toward three things in the next decade, what would they be?”

**Step 2 – Temporal narrative**

Past:

- “What are the three or four key ‘chapters’ in my work/life so far?”  
  Give each a short title and time range.
- “What did each chapter teach me about myself?”

Present:

- “If I had to name the current chapter, what would I call it?”  
  Examples: “Consolidation,” “Transition,” “Stuck but growing internally,” “Expansion.”

Future:

- “If I imagine a chapter five to ten years from now that I’d be proud of, what is its title? What is true there?”

**Step 3 – Layering: me, my roles, my systems**

- “At the inner layer (me), what feels most alive right now?”  
  Skills, curiosity, desires, values.
- “At the role layer (job, practice, band, projects), what feels aligned and what feels off?”
- “At the system layer (organization, industry, broader ecosystem), what feels coherent and what feels hostile to my direction?”

You are separating misalignment sources:

- self vs role vs system.

**Step 4 – Contrast and alternatives**

- “What are the main plausible paths from here?”  
  Examples: deepen current role, shift role within same org, change org, start a side project, change domain, reduce hours, combine work with something else.
- “Which path feels like:
  - the ‘safe’ path,
  - the ‘wild’ path,
  - the ‘quiet but truer’ path?”

- “What would each path give me and cost me over the next three to five years (rough sketch)?”

**Step 5 – Evidence and uncertainty**

- “What do I actually know about these paths from experience or people I trust?”  
- “Where am I romanticizing or catastrophizing?”  
- “What experiments could I run to sense whether a path is really for me?”  
  Examples: shadowing someone, doing a small project, volunteering, teaching, writing, consulting on a tiny scale.

**Step 6 – Emotion and needs**

- “Which path feels like relief?”  
- “Which path feels like excitement mixed with fear?”  
- “Which path feels heavy, even if ‘sensible’?”  
- “What does my reluctance or excitement try to protect?”

**Step 7 – Meta and holding pattern**

- “What do I understand differently about my direction now?”  
- “Can I commit to a *holding pattern* for now?”  
  For example:
  - “Stay where I am for six more months while running one or two experiments.”  
- “What signal would tell me that it is time to move?”  
  For example:
  - specific threshold of misalignment, or a concrete opportunity.

### Safety and limits

- If questions trigger shame, self-attack, or old wounds:
  - slow down,
  - stay closer to present and near-term choices,
  - and consider external support if needed.
- Don’t try to solve “Who am I?” entirely; aim for “What is my next honest step?”

## Situation: Recurring Conflict Reflection (“Why does this keep happening?”)

Goal: examine a recurring tension or conflict pattern in a way that focuses on systems and your own choices, without self-blame spirals.

### Orientation

“In this Stabilization/Growth personal situation, where a pattern of conflict or tension keeps repeating in work or collaboration,  
I want this question space to help me see structural and relational patterns and my own contribution,  
in a way that increases agency without turning into self-blame,  
within a 30–45 minute reflection, staying within this pattern and not replaying every past conflict in my life.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Temporal  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Step 1 – Clarify the pattern**

- “Describe one recent situation where this conflict/tension showed up.”  
- “What happened, in simple terms?”  
- “What is the pattern label I’d give this (for example, ‘I become the fixer’, ‘I avoid escalation’, ‘They treat me as a blocker’)?”

**Step 2 – Temporal view**

- “When did I first notice this kind of pattern in my work?”  
- “In what types of environments does it show up most?”  
  Examples: hierarchical teams, fast-changing projects, with certain personalities.
- “Are there contexts where this pattern does not appear or appears weaker?”

**Step 3 – Causality and consequence**

- “What is the typical chain of events from trigger to outcome?”  
  For example:
  - someone misses a commitment → I pick it up → I feel resentful → I avoid direct feedback → hidden frustration grows → bigger blow-up later.
- “Where in this chain do I still have real choices?”  
  Not control over others, but choices about my own responses and boundaries.

**Step 4 – Emotion and needs**

- “How do I usually feel in the middle of this pattern?”  
- “What needs feel threatened or ignored?”  
  Examples: respect, fairness, autonomy, belonging.
- “What am I trying to protect or avoid when I respond the way I usually do?”

**Step 5 – Assumptions**

- “What am I assuming about others in these situations?”  
  Examples: “They don’t care,” “They can’t handle feedback,” “If I say no, I’ll be punished.”
- “What am I assuming about myself?”  
  Examples: “I have to fix it,” “I shouldn’t complain,” “I’m the only responsible one.”
- “Which assumption, if it were wrong, would change how I act?”

**Step 6 – Boundaries and alternative moves**

- “What would a healthier boundary look like in this pattern?”  
  Examples: saying no earlier, escalating to the right level, asking for clarity, refusing silent extra work.
- “What is one different move I can test next time this pattern starts?”  
  Keep it small and specific:
  - one sentence you will say,
  - one thing you will decline,
  - one question you will ask.

**Step 7 – Meta**

- “What do I understand differently about this recurring pattern now?”  
- “What is one experiment I will try next time, and what will I watch for?”  
- “How will I avoid using this reflection as fuel for self-attack?”

### Safety and limits

- If the pattern involves abuse, discrimination, or serious psychological harm:
  - the main move is to seek support and protection, not better questions.
- QSS can help you see patterns more clearly, but it cannot substitute for organizational or legal protection.

## Using and Extending This Playbook

You now have a small set of personal spaces you can:

- revisit regularly,
- customize,
- and version for your own life.

Suggestions:

- Create a `personal-qss` folder with:
  - `role-decision-v1.0.md`
  - `energy-check-v1.0.md`
  - `direction-check-v1.0.md`
  - `conflict-pattern-v1.0.md`
- After using one:
  - jot a few notes on what worked, what didn’t,
  - adjust phrasing and order,
  - increment version if changes are significant.

Remember the limits:

- If a reflection turns up things that feel too heavy, dangerous, or clinical:
  - QSS becomes a **signal**, not the solution.
  - The responsible next step is some form of human support.

The goal of these spaces is not to solve you.  
It is to give you **clearer, kinder conversations with yourself** so that your next step can be more intentional.
