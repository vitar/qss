# Domain Playbook: Software Delivery and Consulting

This playbook shows how to turn QSS into concrete question spaces for:

- client–vendor engagements,
- internal delivery practice,
- product and project leadership situations.

It does not try to cover everything.  
Instead, it gives you a **small set of reusable spaces** you can adapt:

- Setup spaces for new engagements.
- Stabilization spaces for when delivery drifts or conflict appears.
- Growth spaces for improving how delivery and consulting work.

You can copy these structures as-is, or treat them as scaffolding to design your own.

## How to use this playbook

For each situation you’ll see:

- Orientation – what the space is for and who it is for.
- Suggested topology – which dimensions to activate.
- Flow sketch – a practical path with example questions.
- Notes on power, safety, and evidence – how to keep it humane and realistic.

Typical use-cases:

- Discovery and scoping for new work.
- Resetting misaligned fixed-bid projects.
- Handling escalations without burning bridges.
- Aligning internal practices and leadership on delivery trade-offs.

You are expected to tweak phrasing to your own voice and context.

## Situation: New Client–Vendor Engagement (Setup Mode)

Goal: avoid the classic “we thought you meant X / we assumed you would do Y” pattern before it hardens into conflict.

### Orientation

“In this Setup situation, with client holding commercial power and vendor being evaluated on delivery,  
I want this question space to help us build a shared picture of the problem, value, constraints, and boundaries,  
in a way that feels predictable and transparent for both sides,  
within a 60-minute remote or in-person session, staying within work context and not drifting into contract negotiations or therapy.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Value & Impact  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs (light)  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Entry – Clarification**

- “In your own words, what problem are we trying to solve with this engagement?”  
  (client first, then vendor)  
- “If we had to summarize this into one sentence we both agree on, what would it be?”

**Value & Impact**

- “What would make you call this engagement a success in six to twelve months?”  
- “Who is most affected if we get this right? Who is most affected if we don’t?”  
- “If we have to trade between speed, scope, predictability, and cost, what tends to matter most for you?”

**Assumptions**

- “What are you expecting from us that we have not explicitly agreed on yet?”  
- “What are we expecting from you that we may not have said out loud?”  
- “Which constraints are you treating as fixed right now? Which are flexible?”

**Boundaries and ownership**

- “Which decisions do you expect us to own? Which decisions do you expect to own yourself?”  
  (architecture, backlog ordering, timelines, scope cuts, release approvals)  
- “Are there any decisions you explicitly do not want us to own, even if they affect outcomes?”  
- “Where do you see the riskiest handoffs between orgs or teams?”

**Evidence and uncertainty**

- “What do we actually know from history about similar initiatives in your org?”  
  (timelines, typical blockers, dependency patterns)  
- “What are we guessing or hoping will be different this time?”  
- “If we are wrong about those guesses, where will it hurt first?”

**Light emotional / relational field**

- “You’ve likely worked with vendors or internal teams on similar efforts.  
  Is there one thing from past experiences that you definitely want to avoid repeating here?”  
- “What would make this collaboration feel respectful and predictable for you?”

**Meta and next steps**

- “What became clearer for you in this conversation?”  
- “Is there any concern we haven’t named that you want visible, even if we can’t solve it now?”  
- “What are our next concrete steps in the next one to two weeks?”

### Power, safety, evidence notes

- Power: client usually holds stronger commercial power; vendor people carry more execution risk.  
  Avoid using this space to argue about contract terms; stay in problem, value, expectations, and boundaries.
- Emotion: keep Emotion & Needs scoped to collaboration and prior vendor experiences, not personal life.
- Evidence: gently separate “we believe vendors always…” from “in the last two projects we saw…”.

## Situation: Fixed-Bid Delivery Drift (Stabilization Mode)

Goal: project is slipping, tension is rising, but cancellation is not yet on the table. You need to stabilize understanding and reduce friction.

### Orientation

“In this Stabilization situation, with client frustrated about delays and vendor under delivery and margin pressure,  
I want this question space to help us understand why we are drifting, surface expectations and boundaries, and agree on small stabilizing changes,  
in a way that is honest but non-blaming,  
within a 60-minute joint session, staying within work context and not turning into legal negotiation.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Temporal  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Value & Impact  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta / Reflexive  

### Flow sketch

**Entry – multi-perspective recap**

- “From your perspective, what has been happening with this project over the last few weeks?”  
  (client first, then vendor)  
- “What has been most frustrating or worrying for you?”

Reflect back both pictures. Check: “Is there anything important missing from what I just summarized?”

**Temporal and clarification**

- “Looking back, are there one or two key moments where we started to diverge from plan?”  
- “What changed at those points? Scope, dependencies, people, decisions?”

**Assumptions**

- “Thinking about those moments, what did you expect the other side would do that did not happen?”  
- “What do you think the other side expected from you?”  
- “Which expectations were never explicitly discussed?”

Highlight a small set of high-impact assumptions.

**Boundaries and ownership**

- “Where was ownership unclear? For example: who approves scope changes, who decides on quality vs speed trade-offs, who manages dependencies?”  
- “Were there decisions that both sides thought they owned?”  
- “Are there decisions that currently nobody clearly owns?”

**Emotion and needs**

Phrase it around collaboration and work:

- “Right now, how does this collaboration feel for you: more supportive or more draining?”  
- “Is there anything that happened that quietly eroded your trust or energy?”  
- “What would need to change for this to feel workable again?”

If you are the vendor or in power, start with your side:

- “From our side, here is where we likely contributed to that feeling…”

**Value, impact, and evidence**

- “What is most at risk if we continue as we have?”  
- “What is most important to protect: timeline, relationship, budget, team sustainability, user impact?”  
- “What do we actually know from data (burn-up, defect rates, throughput, dependencies) about why we’re slipping?”  
- “What are we assuming about causes that we have not tested?”

**Minimal reset and Meta**

- “What is one concrete change we can commit to in the next one to two sprints that would stabilize this?”  
  Examples: changed cadence, clearer decision gate, smaller batch size, prioritized dependency clearing.
- “What is one thing we need to stop doing right now because it’s making things worse?”  
- “Did anything about this conversation feel unsafe or unfair?”  
- “What was most useful, and what would you adjust next time?”

### Power, safety, evidence notes

- Power: if you facilitate as a vendor, avoid self-defensive wording; own your part in assumptions and boundaries.
- Emotion: do not push for personal disclosure; keep it at collaboration level.  
  If strong distress appears, slow down and consider moving deeper emotional processing to a different space.
- Evidence: focus on concrete signals (backlog readiness, dependency queues, approval delays) rather than generic claims (“developers are slow”, “client changes mind”).

## Situation: Escalation / Threat of Cancellation (Stabilization Mode, High Stakes)

Goal: the client is angry or considering cancellation; internal teams are defensive. You need to de-escalate and reframe from “speed” to “stability and outcomes”.

This is sensitive; you may use this as a *design reference* for an escalation call or as an internal pre-call alignment space.

### Orientation

“In this high-stakes Stabilization situation, with a client threatening cancellation and internal teams defensive and tired,  
I want this question space to help us acknowledge frustration, re-anchor around desired outcomes, and propose a reset structure that serves the client’s interests,  
in a way that preserves dignity and trust where possible,  
within a tight timebox, staying within professional and commercial boundaries.”

### Suggested topology

External (with client):

- Clarification  
- Value & Impact  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs (light, focused on partnership)  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta / Reflexive  

Internal (with engineering/product):

- Clarification  
- Emotion & Needs  
- Assumptions  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Value & Impact  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Meta  

### Flow sketch – external reset frame (client-facing)

**Entry – acknowledge and clarify**

- “I can hear how frustrating this has been for you, especially given the stakes.  
  Before we discuss options, can we briefly align on how you see the current situation?”

Let client speak. Reflect back concisely.

- “From what I hear, the main issues are A, B, C. Did I miss anything critical?”

**Value and impact**

- “Stepping back from the last weeks, what outcome matters most to you right now?”  
  Options: hitting a key date, protecting internal credibility, avoiding further waste, proving value of the initiative.  
- “If we can’t achieve everything originally imagined, what would still make this engagement worth it for you?”

**Emotion and relational tone**

Keep this contextual, not therapeutic:

- “Given what’s happened, what would need to change in how we work together for this to feel workable again?”  
- “Is there anything in our behavior or communication that has particularly damaged your trust?”

Own what you can without self-destruction.

**Assumptions and boundaries**

- “Looking back, where do you feel your expectations of us were most different from what we delivered?”  
- “Where do you think we misread your expectations or constraints?”  
- “Are there decisions you thought we would own that we did not, or vice versa?”

**Evidence and uncertainty**

- “To decide what to do next, we need clarity on two things:  
  what has actually been delivered, and what is realistically possible from here.”  
- “What evidence or view of the current state would help you feel confident in any next-step decision?”  
  Examples: audited backlog, demo walkthrough, shortened roadmap options.

**Propose reset structure**

Instead of selling “a workshop”, frame it as client protection:

- “Given the stakes and your concerns, I recommend a short reset structure focused on your interests:
  - clarify what we keep, cut, or change,
  - agree on decision boundaries and trade-off rules,
  - and define a shorter, more predictable path from here.  
  Does that sound like something that could help you decide whether and how to continue?”

**Meta**

- “Is there anything about how we’re approaching this that feels like stalling rather than serving your interests?”  
- “What would you need to see in the next two weeks to regain some confidence?”

### Power, safety, evidence notes

- Power: client holds strong leverage; your space must center their outcomes, not your comfort.
- Emotion: acknowledge frustration explicitly; avoid defensiveness. Do not ask them to justify their feelings.
- Evidence: be prepared with concrete data and options; do not promise what engineering cannot support.

## Situation: Internal Alignment – Product, Project, Engineering (Setup/Growth Mix)

Goal: internal leadership (PM, Product, Engineering) keeps tripping over each other; you want a shared model of “how we work together” for a specific product or project.

### Orientation

“In this mixed Setup/Growth situation, with Product, Project/Delivery, and Engineering leads carrying different incentives and narratives,  
I want this question space to help us build a shared picture of value, roles, and trade-offs for this product/project,  
in a way that feels respectful and practical,  
within a 90-minute internal workshop, staying within work context and avoiding performance reviews or blame.”

### Suggested topology

- Clarification  
- Value & Impact  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Boundaries & Ownership  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs (light)  
- Meta  

### Flow sketch

**Entry – product/problem clarity**

- “In one or two sentences, how do you describe what this product/project is for?”  
  (each role answers)  
- “What are the top one to three outcomes this effort must deliver in the next year?”

**Layering – different altitudes**

- “At the feature level, what does ‘success’ look like?”  
- “At the product/business level?”  
- “At the organization/client level?”  
- “Where do we see conflicting priorities between these layers?”

**Boundaries and ownership**

For each major area (value, scope, sequencing, quality, risk):

- “Who is accountable for defining this?”  
- “Who is accountable for challenging and validating it?”  
- “Where do we want shared ownership vs clear single-owner decisions?”

Capture mismatches explicitly.

**Causality and consequence**

- “When we look at our current way of working, what patterns repeatedly lead to:  
  - last-minute crunch,  
  - scope creep,  
  - technical debt spikes,  
  - stakeholder surprises?”  
- “Which parts of this are caused by unclear roles/decisions, and which by genuine uncertainty or constraints?”

**Evidence and uncertainty**

- “What do we know from the last releases about:  
  - lead time,  
  - unplanned work,  
  - decision bottlenecks?”  
- “Where are we acting on assumptions about each other’s work (for example, ‘PM always…’, ‘Engineering never…’) without concrete evidence?”

**Light emotional / relational field**

- “What is most draining in how we currently work together across Product, Project, Engineering?”  
- “What is most energizing that we want more of?”  
- “Is there any behavior pattern that is quietly harming trust but rarely gets named?”

Keep this about patterns, not individuals.

**Meta and next steps**

- “What feels clearer about how we should work together?”  
- “What is one change in decision-making or roles we agree to experiment with for the next one or two iterations?”  
- “When will we check back on whether this change helped?”

### Power, safety, evidence notes

- Power: be aware of unofficial power (for example, senior engineer vs junior PM).
- Emotion: use group norms (for example, “speak about patterns, not people”).  
- Evidence: bring simple metrics or concrete incidents; avoid abstract blaming narratives.

## Situation: Delivery Practice / DevEx Improvement (Growth Mode)

Goal: you want to improve delivery quality, predictability, or developer experience across projects, not just fix a single one.

### Orientation

“In this Growth situation, with practice leads and senior engineers wanting better delivery and DevEx,  
I want this question space to help us see patterns, trade-offs, and experiments that improve how we work,  
in a way that is honest about constraints but curious about possibilities,  
within a two-hour workshop or a series of shorter sessions, staying within organizational and technical context.”

### Suggested topology

- Value & Impact  
- Layering / Abstraction  
- Causality & Consequence  
- Evidence & Uncertainty  
- Contrast & Alternatives  
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs  
- Meta  

### Flow sketch

**Entry – define value and scope**

- “When we say we want ‘better delivery’ or ‘better DevEx’, what do we really mean in this organization?”  
- “If we had to pick two primary things to improve in the next six to twelve months, what would they be?”  
  Examples: predictability, fewer after-hours emergencies, less context switching, better quality, more meaningful work.

**Layering – zooming out from individual teams**

- “What patterns do we see across multiple teams or projects that impact these outcomes?”  
- “Which of these patterns are local (team-level), and which are systemic (org-level)?”

**Causality and consequence**

- “For each problematic pattern, what is the most plausible cause-effect chain?”  
  Examples: sales promises → over-committed scope → rushed delivery → burnout and defects.  
- “Which of these chains do we actually have influence over at practice level?”

**Evidence and uncertainty**

- “What do we actually know about our delivery performance and DevEx?”  
  (pull in metrics, survey results, attrition data, anecdotal evidence)  
- “Where are we acting on assumptions, slogans, or borrowed narratives (for example, ‘we need more squads’, ‘we need SAFe’) without evidence?”  
- “If we could run one or two experiments to reduce uncertainty, what would they be?”

**Contrast and alternatives**

- “What are two or three very different approaches we could take?”  
  Examples: fewer WIP initiatives, dedicated platform teams, stronger discovery practices, explicit work agreements with clients.  
- “For each, what are the likely consequences in the next six to twelve months? Who wins, who loses?”

**Emotion and needs**

Focus on work experience:

- “What currently makes this environment draining for engineers, PMs, and leaders?”  
- “What makes it meaningful and energizing?”  
- “What do people need more or less of to stay sustainable at a high level of craft?”  
- “Which of these are within our power to influence as a practice, and which need organizational sponsorship?”

**Meta and action**

- “What did we see differently about our delivery system today?”  
- “Which one or two changes or experiments do we commit to now?”  
- “How will we measure or sense whether they help?”  
- “When will we run a follow-up session to review and adjust?”

### Power, safety, evidence notes

- Power: practice leads may have limited formal power; be honest about what is realistically changeable vs aspirational.
- Emotion: watch for cynicism; validate fatigue without turning the session into a vent-only space.
- Evidence: balance metrics with lived experience; avoid weaponizing data against teams.

## Using and Extending This Playbook

You can now:

- Copy one of these spaces into your personal library.
- Adjust Orientation, topology, and flow for a specific engagement or internal situation.
- After using it, apply recursion:
  - record what worked, what didn’t,
  - tweak for v1.1, v2.0.

You will likely end up with your own variants, such as:

- “Light Discovery Call” space for 30-minute early conversations.
- “Internal framing session” space before any client-facing meeting.
- “DevEx health check” space that can be reused across teams quarterly.

The point of this playbook is not to be exhaustive.  
It is to **seed your own Question Space System for software delivery and consulting**, so that over time you have a small, sharp set of spaces that fit your style, your organization, and your clients.
