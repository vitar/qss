# Designing Flow and Pathways

You have Orientation and a chosen Topology (dimensions).

Next question:

> “In what order do we move through these dimensions, how deep do we go, and how do we land?”

That is **Flow**:

- Entry – how you start.
- Sequence – which dimensions you visit and in what order.
- Depth control – how far you go in each.
- Branching – how you adapt to what emerges.
- Exit – how you close and integrate.

This chapter gives you:

- Flow components explained.
- Mode-based heuristics (Setup, Stabilization, Growth).
- A few reusable flow patterns.
- Power- and safety-aware entry/exit choices.
- Concrete example flows from your domains.

## Why Flow Matters

The same topology (set of dimensions) can behave very differently depending on flow:

- A safe flow:
  - builds trust gradually,
  - puts difficult questions later when there is more shared ground,
  - ends with clarity and next steps.
- A bad flow:
  - asks exposing questions too early,
  - jumps between topics,
  - ends on a cliff with no integration.

Flow is where you turn “nice ideas” into something actual humans can walk through.

## Components of Flow

When you design flow, think in five pieces.

### Entry

Entry sets:

- tone (threatening vs inviting),
- focus (clear vs vague),
- and safety.

Good entries:

- are simple,
- are anchored in Orientation,
- do not demand vulnerability before a basic map exists.

Entry examples:

- “Can we each describe, briefly, what problem we think we’re here to solve?”
- “Before we talk about options, can we first name what ‘success’ would look like for you?”
- “Let’s start with a quick recap of what’s been happening from your point of view.”

Entry mistakes:

- “Why did you fail to…?” as the first question.
- Starting with deep emotional exposure in a low-trust, high-power-gap setting.
- Starting with abstract philosophy when people are scared or tired.

### Sequence

Sequence = **order of dimensions**.

Typical skeleton:

- Context / Clarification
- 1–2 structural dimensions (Assumptions, Boundaries, Value)
- Optional Emotion & Needs segment
- Evidence & Uncertainty (if needed)
- Consequences / decisions
- Meta / closure

You can:

- keep it linear (simple),
- or add small branches (adaptive).

### Depth Control

Depth control = **how many questions per dimension** and how far you go.

Guidelines:

- Start with 1–3 questions per dimension.
- Only go deeper if:
  - there is energy (interest, engagement),
  - or pain that clearly needs attention,
  - and you have time.
- Avoid “drilling” one dimension for 30 minutes while others are untouched, unless that is your explicit intent.

Signals to stop going deeper:

- Repetition: same answer in different words.
- Shutdown: shorter and shorter replies, visible tension.
- Time: you’re halfway through time but still on dimension one.

### Branching

Branching = **conditional paths** based on what shows up.

Simple patterns:

- If strong disagreement appears → branch to Assumptions and Boundaries.
- If visible frustration appears → branch to Emotion & Needs, with care.
- If facts are disputed → branch to Evidence & Uncertainty.

Branches can be:

- “If X happens, I’ll ask these two backup questions.”
- “If nothing intense shows up, I’ll skip that branch.”

You don’t need complex branching diagrams; just 1–2 “if–then” notes.

### Exit

Exit = how you **land the plane**:

- Meta reflection:
  - “What became clearer?”
  - “What still feels unresolved?”
- Integration:
  - key takeaways,
  - 1–3 next steps (if appropriate),
  - or a clear “parking lot” for what you cannot resolve now.

Exits that work:

- “Given all this, what’s one concrete change we’ll try next?”
- “What do you want to remember from this conversation a week from now?”
- “Is there anything we surfaced that needs to be taken to a different space (manager, therapist, lawyer, doctor)?”

Exits that hurt:

- Ending on raw emotion with no containment.
- Ending on big open questions with no next step.
- Ending abruptly due to time without at least a tiny Meta check.

## Mode-Based Flow Heuristics

Flow should match the mode you’re in.

### Setup Mode – Gentle Structure, More Future Than Past

Intent:

- build initial shared meaning,
- set expectations,
- prevent obvious misalignment.

Flow shape:

- Start:
  - Clarification,
  - Value & Impact.
- Middle:
  - Assumptions,
  - Boundaries & Ownership,
  - light Evidence & Uncertainty.
- Optional:
  - light Emotion & Needs.
- Exit:
  - Meta and 1–2 explicit agreements.

Example sketch (Setup, 45–60 min):

1. Clarification  
   “What problem are we trying to solve?” (each side)  
   Summarize.

2. Value & Impact  
   “What would success look like for you?”  
   “Who is most affected if we succeed or fail?”

3. Assumptions  
   “What expectations are you holding about us / this project that we haven’t said out loud?”  
   “What are we assuming about your role and decision power?”

4. Boundaries & Ownership  
   “Which decisions do you expect us to own, and which do you want to own yourself?”  
   “Where are you most worried about handoffs?”

5. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   “What do we actually know about similar efforts (data, history)?”  
   “What are we guessing?”

6. Light Emotion & Needs (if safe)  
   “What would make this collaboration feel predictable and respectful for you?”

7. Meta & next steps  
   “What became clearer today?”  
   “One concrete next step we agree to.”

### Stabilization Mode – Repair Before Ambition

Intent:

- understand what broke,
- reduce emotional and relational friction,
- find small stabilizing changes.

Flow shape:

- Start:
  - Multi-perspective recap (Clarification),
  - feelings and frustrations *about the situation*.
- Middle:
  - Assumptions,
  - Boundaries,
  - Evidence & Uncertainty.
- Emotional core:
  - Emotion & Needs (present, context-bound).
- Exit:
  - small commitments,
  - Meta.

Example sketch (Stabilization, 60 min):

1. Clarification via stories  
   “From your perspective, what has been happening over the last X weeks?” (each side)  
   Reflect back.

2. Emotion & Needs (early but scoped)  
   “What has been most frustrating or draining about this for you?”  
   “What do you need more of or less of to feel this is workable?”

3. Assumptions  
   “What did you expect would happen that didn’t?”  
   “What did you think the other side would do?”

4. Boundaries & Ownership  
   “Where did we have unclear ownership or decisions?”  
   “Which handoffs felt most risky or ambiguous?”

5. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   “What actually happened (events, dates, impacts) versus what we’ve told ourselves?”  
   “What are we assuming about each other’s motives that might be wrong?”

6. Value & Impact  
   “What is most at risk if we don’t change anything?”  
   “What is most important to protect going forward?”

7. Minimal reset & Meta  
   “One small change we can commit to in the next 1–2 weeks?”  
   “Did any part of this conversation feel unsafe or unhelpful?”  
   “What felt most useful?”

### Growth Mode – Exploration With Guardrails

Intent:

- extend, deepen, or generalize understanding,
- explore options and trade-offs,
- design experiments or longer-term direction.

Flow shape:

- Start:
  - Value & Impact,
  - Temporal (future).
- Middle:
  - Contrast & Alternatives,
  - Causality & Consequence,
  - Layering.
- Evidence block:
  - Evidence & Uncertainty.
- Exit:
  - choices, hypotheses, experiments,
  - Meta.

Example sketch (Growth, 60–90 min):

1. Value & Impact  
   “What are we trying to maximize over the next 1–3 years (impact, learning, revenue, enjoyment, reputation)?”

2. Temporal  
   “If we imagine ourselves in 3 years and things went well, what’s true?”  
   “What would we regret not trying?”

3. Contrast & Alternatives  
   “What are the main paths we see?”  
   “What’s the ‘safe’ path? The ‘bold’ path? The ‘hybrid’ path?”

4. Causality & Consequence  
   “If we pick each path, what is the most plausible chain of events over the next year?”  
   “Who wins, who loses, under each scenario?”

5. Layering  
   “How do these paths affect us as individuals, as a team/band/company, and as part of a larger ecosystem?”

6. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   “What do we know about similar situations?”  
   “What are we guessing or hoping?”  
   “What experiments would reduce our uncertainty?”

7. Decisions / bets & Meta  
   “Which path (or experiment) feels like the best trade-off now?”  
   “What is our next small step?”  
   “What did this conversation highlight that we should revisit later?”

## Reusable Flow Patterns

Here are pattern “shapes” you can apply to any topology.

### Pattern 1 – Shallow Pass → Targeted Deep Dive

Use when:

- time is limited,
- you’re not sure where the real problem sits.

Shape:

1. Shallow pass (1–2 questions per dimension):  
   Clarification → Value & Impact → Assumptions → Boundaries → Emotion & Needs → Evidence.

2. Meta:
   - “Which part of this feels most unclear, risky, or emotionally loaded?”

3. Deep dive:
   - Spend remaining time on that dimension + one adjacent dimension.

Example:

- In an escalation, shallow pass reveals:
  - emotion high, assumptions wildly different.  
  You deep dive into Emotion & Needs + Assumptions.

### Pattern 2 – Two-Phase Flow (Facts First, Then Meaning)

Use when:

- stories conflict,
- accusations are flying.

Shape:

1. Phase 1 – What happened:
   - Clarification,
   - Temporal,
   - Evidence & Uncertainty.

2. Phase 2 – What it means:
   - Assumptions,
   - Emotion & Needs,
   - Value & Impact,
   - Meta.

Keeps people from arguing about meaning before they have at least some shared ground on events.

### Pattern 3 – Branch on Signal

Use when:

- you want adaptability without complexity.

Shape:

1. Core trunk (always):
   - Clarification → Value & Impact.

2. Branch conditions:
   - If strong disagreement → Assumptions + Boundaries.
   - If visible frustration → Emotion & Needs (careful, scoped).
   - If data claims conflict → Evidence & Uncertainty.

3. Return:
   - Consequences → Meta.

In practice:

- You start with trunk.
- You pick exactly one branch based on strongest signal.
- You don’t try to cover everything.

### Pattern 4 – Ladder Flow (Abstract ↔ Concrete)

Use when:

- people get stuck either in details or high-level talk.

Shape:

1. Abstract:
   - “At a high level, what are we trying to do here?” (Value & Impact / Layering)

2. Concrete:
   - “Give one concrete example of where this shows up today.” (Clarification)

3. Abstract:
   - “What pattern does this example belong to?” (Layering / Causality)

4. Concrete:
   - “What is one specific change we can test in that example?” (Consequences / Boundaries)

It’s basically:

> zoom out → zoom in → zoom out → zoom in, on purpose.

### Pattern 5 – Funnel Flow (Wide → Narrow)

Use when:

- decisions must be made,
- you want to avoid premature convergence.

Shape:

1. Wide exploration:
   - Value & Impact,
   - Contrast & Alternatives (list options).
2. Narrowing:
   - Causality & Consequence (for each option),
   - Evidence & Uncertainty (confidence, blind spots).
3. Commit:
   - choose a direction or experiment,
   - define next steps.
4. Meta:
   - check regrets or unresolved fears.

## Power- and Safety-Aware Flow Design

Flow is where you **encode respect for power and safety**.

Guidelines:

- Do not start with Emotion & Needs in:
  - manager–direct reports,
  - client–vendor escalations,
  - any context where people fear evaluation.
- Do start with:
  - Clarification,
  - Value & Impact,
  - system-level questions, not personal blame.

Safer phrasing for Emotion & Needs:

- “How does this collaboration / setup feel?”  
  instead of  
  “How do you feel about your life / career / leader?”

- “What in our current process makes it harder for you to do your best work?”  
  instead of  
  “What do you resent?”

If you are in power:

- Ask self-directed questions early:
  - “Where do you think I may have set unclear or unrealistic expectations?”
  - “What have I done that made it harder for you to speak up?”

If strong distress appears mid-flow:

- Pause.
- Name what you see (lightly, respectfully).
- Decide whether to:
  - slow down and stay shallow, or
  - stop and suggest a different space (manager, therapist, HR, doctor, etc.).

## Phrasing Micro-Patterns

Flow is not just dimension order, it’s also **micro-phrasing**:

Some useful patterns:

- “In your own words…”  
  invites less performance, more authenticity.

- “From your perspective…”  
  acknowledges multiple truths.

- “Right now…”  
  keeps emotion questions in present context.

- “One small example…”  
  prevents people from having to summarize their entire career or life.

- “What would you be comfortable sharing here?”  
  returns control when exposure risk is high.

Avoid:

- “Why are you like this?” (identity attack)
- “Don’t you think…?” (leading, manipulative)
- “Isn’t it obvious that…?” (shaming)

## Example Flows From Your Domains

### Example 1 – Client–Vendor Setup for Fixed-Bid Project (60 min)

Orientation (implicit):

- Setup, high stakes, client holds power, vendor under pressure.
- Goal: shared understanding, expectations, and first boundaries.

Topology:

- Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty, light Emotion & Needs, Meta.

Flow:

1. Clarification  
   - “In one or two sentences, how do you describe the core problem this project should solve?” (client first, then vendor)  
   - Summarize both views.

2. Value & Impact  
   - “What would make you call this project a clear success in six months?”  
   - “Who is most affected if we miss that?”

3. Assumptions  
   - “What are you expecting from us that we haven’t explicitly agreed on yet?”  
   - “What are we expecting from you that we may not have clearly asked for?”

4. Boundaries & Ownership  
   - “Which decisions do you want to own? Which do you want us to own?”  
   - Capture 2–3 key boundaries.

5. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   - “What do we know about similar projects (timelines, risks)?”  
   - “What are we guessing, and how big is the bet if we’re wrong?”

6. Light Emotion & Needs  
   - “You’ve likely worked with vendors before. Is there one thing you want us to avoid repeating from past experiences?”

7. Meta & next steps  
   - “What feels clearer after this conversation?”  
   - “Is there any concern we haven’t named that you’d like visible?”  
   - “One concrete next step we each commit to.”

### Example 2 – Stabilizing Internal Team After Rough Release (45 min retro)

Topology:

- Clarification, Emotion & Needs, Assumptions, Boundaries, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

Flow:

1. Clarification  
   - “Very briefly, what happened around this release from your point of view?” (round-robin)  
   - “Anything important missing from this picture?”

2. Emotion & Needs (scoped)  
   - “On a scale from 1–10, how supported did you feel during this release?”  
   - “What’s one thing that made it lower than you’d like?”  
   - “What’s one thing that helped?”

3. Assumptions  
   - “What did you expect from others that you didn’t get (and never explicitly asked for)?”  
   - Collect 2–3 patterns.

4. Boundaries & Ownership  
   - “Where was ownership unclear (who decides X, who executes Y, who communicates Z)?”

5. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   - “What do we know about the actual impact of these release issues (users, incidents, metrics)?”  
   - “What are we assuming was disastrous but might be specific and limited?”

6. Minimal reset and Meta  
   - “One change we’ll try in our next release process.”  
   - “One thing about this discussion you’d keep, one you’d drop next time.”

### Example 3 – Personal Role Decision (30–40 min solo)

Topology:

- Value & Impact, Emotion & Needs, Temporal, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

Flow:

1. Value & Impact  
   - “What do I want my work to give me over the next 2–3 years?”  
   - “Who else does this decision affect, and how much weight do I give that?”

2. Emotion & Needs  
   - “Which parts of my current situation feel energizing? Which feel draining?”  
   - “Which of my needs (safety, respect, belonging, creativity, growth, autonomy) are met? Which are not?”

3. Temporal  
   - Past:
     - “When in the last 3–5 years did I feel most ‘right’ in my work?”  
   - Future:
     - “If nothing changes for 12 months, how do I imagine feeling?”  
     - “If I imagine taking the new role and it goes well, what is true? If it goes badly, what is true?”

4. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   - “What do I actually know about this new role from concrete experience or trustworthy sources?”  
   - “What am I assuming (about politics, growth, recognition)? How could I be wrong?”  
   - “What small experiment or conversation could reduce my uncertainty?”

5. Meta and small step  
   - “What feels more stable in my thinking after this?”  
   - “What is still foggy?”  
   - “One small, low-risk step I’ll take in the next week.”

### Example 4 – Mixing Direction for Live Recording (45 min band discussion)

Topology:

- Contrast & Alternatives, Value & Impact, Emotion & Needs, Causality & Consequence, Evidence & Uncertainty, Meta.

Flow:

1. Contrast & Alternatives  
   - “Let’s name two extremes: ‘audiophile polish’ vs ‘raw live energy’. What would each sound and feel like for this album?”  
   - Sketch both.

2. Value & Impact  
   - “What do we want our audience to feel when they listen?”  
   - “What matters more for us: translation on any system, or capturing the live chaos we love?”

3. Emotion & Needs  
   - “Which direction feels more true to what *we* enjoy when we listen back?”  
   - “Is anyone strongly attached to one direction or strongly afraid of one?”

4. Causality & Consequence  
   - “If we choose more polish, what happens to our identity and to expectations for the next gig/recording?”  
   - “If we choose more raw, what happens to listenability on casual systems and to perception by bookers / festival organizers?”

5. Evidence & Uncertainty  
   - “What do we know from past recordings or gigs about what our audience responds to?”  
   - “What are we guessing?”  
   - “Any reference albums we agree are close to what we want?”

6. Decision and Meta  
   - “Given all this, which direction (or blend) do we commit to for this record?”  
   - “Anything about this decision we’re uneasy about and want to keep an eye on?”  
   - “What did this conversation surface that we might use for future creative decisions?”

## Handing Off to Recursion

After designing and running a flow, the next Practice chapter (`250-recursion-and-iteration-loops.md`) will help you:

- review how the flow actually behaved,
- decide what to keep, change, or retire,
- and start building your own library of flows that fit your patterns of work.

If a flow feels off, your debug questions are:

- “Did I start in the wrong place?”  
- “Did I go too deep in one dimension and ignore others?”  
- “Did I misread the mode (Setup vs Stabilization vs Growth)?”  
- “Did I underestimate power or safety issues?”

Flow is a living thing.  
Each time you use a space, you are not just asking questions—you are also learning how your flows should evolve.
