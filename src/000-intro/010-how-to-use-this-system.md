# How to Use This System

This is the **quick operator’s guide** for the Question Space System.

You can read it top to bottom once, then treat it as a checklist when you design or run spaces.

## When to use QSS

Reach for QSS when you notice any of these:

- “We keep talking and nothing really changes.”
- “We are arguing about solutions without agreeing on the problem.”
- “People are frustrated but it’s not clear why.”
- “I’m stuck between options and my pros/cons list is just noise.”
- “We are about to start something important and I don’t trust our setup.”

Typical contexts:

- client–vendor engagements,
- internal project setups or resets,
- team retros and alignment discussions,
- personal reflection about role, energy, or direction,
- music and creative decisions (mix direction, band identity, priorities).

If the situation looks like:

- imminent harm,
- medical or mental health crisis,
- legal dispute,
- abuse or harassment,

then QSS is not the main tool.  
You can still use some clarity questions for yourself, but the next step should be **appropriate professional or organizational support**, not deeper QSS work.

## The basic workflow in five moves

You can summarize QSS usage as:

1) Orient  
2) Pick dimensions  
3) Sketch a flow  
4) Run the space  
5) Learn and adjust

You do not have to be perfect. The system is built to **learn with you**.

### Step 1 – Orient

Use the Context Intake guide as your starting point.

**Step 1a – Name the situation**

Write one sentence:

- “What is happening?”
- “Is this about:
  - starting,
  - stabilizing,
  - or growing/improving?”

Pick a **Mode guess**:

- Setup,
- Stabilization,
- or Growth.

**Step 1b – Map power and safety**

Quickly assess:

- Power Asymmetry:
  - Low / Medium / High.
- Safety:
  - Low / Medium / High.

Apply the **Safety Check**:

- Safety Check = (Power Asymmetry == High) AND (Safety == Low)

If Safety Check is true:

- Do not use direct interrogation patterns.
- Avoid:
  - spotlighting lower-power individuals with difficult personal questions,
  - “why didn’t you…” prompts in front of higher power.
- Prefer:
  - system-level questions,
  - small or 1:1 formats,
  - anonymous or written input,
  - or improving conditions before running a space at all.

**Step 1c – Define intent and scope**

Clarify:

- Cognitive goals:
  - what you want to understand, decide, or map.
- Relational goals:
  - how you want the conversation to feel.
- Scope boundaries:
  - what this space will not handle
    - (therapy, legal advice, clinical diagnosis, crisis).

From this you can write a one-sentence **Orientation**:

> “In this [Mode] situation, with [power and safety picture],  
>  I want this space to help [cognitive goals] in a way that feels [relational goals],  
>  within [time/format], staying out of [out-of-scope areas].”

You can keep this private, or share a simple version with participants.

### Step 2 – Pick dimensions (Topology)

Go to:

- Theory:
  - Dimensions of inquiry,
- or Reference:
  - Question pattern cheatsheets.

Choose **3–5 dimensions** that fit your Mode and context. For example:

- Setup:
  - Clarification, Value & Impact, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Evidence & Uncertainty.
- Stabilization:
  - Clarification, Temporal, Emotion & Needs, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership.
- Growth:
  - Value & Impact, Contrast & Alternatives, Causality & Consequence, Temporal, Evidence & Uncertainty.

You can keep some dimensions **light** (few, gentle questions) and some **central** (where you go deeper).

### Step 3 – Sketch a simple flow

You do not need a full workshop design each time.

Use the Flow Design template from Reference as a spine and keep it small:

- Entry:
  - 1 opening question,
- Segment 1:
  - 2–3 questions to ground in reality,
- Segment 2:
  - 3–4 questions on the core dimensions,
- Exit:
  - 2–3 questions for integration and next step.

Example for a quick Stabilization space:

- Entry:
  - “From your perspective, what has been happening?”
- Segment 1 (Clarification, Temporal):
  - “When did this start to feel off?”
  - “What changed around that time?”
- Segment 2 (Emotion & Needs, Assumptions, Boundaries):
  - “What has been most frustrating or draining?”
  - “What did you expect would happen that didn’t?”
  - “Where was ownership or decision-making unclear?”
- Exit (Value, Meta, next step):
  - “What is most important to protect going forward?”
  - “One small change we will try in the next two weeks?”
  - “What about this conversation was helpful or unhelpful?”

You can copy a flow from the domain playbooks and adapt it instead of designing from scratch.

### Step 4 – Run the space

As you run it:

- stick to Orientation:
  - if conversation drifts far away, decide consciously whether to follow or park it,
- use the cheatsheets to adjust phrasing to your voice,
- watch power and safety:
  - if someone looks uneasy, soften or shift to system-level questions,
- include at least one **Meta** moment:
  - “Is this still helpful, or should we change direction?”

If you hit clear red flags (harm, legal, clinical, abuse):

- slow down,
- explicitly acknowledge that this is beyond what this kind of conversation can safely hold,
- and suggest or seek appropriate support.

### Step 5 – Learn and adjust (Recursion)

Right after, take a few minutes for **recursion**:

- note what worked and what did not,
- check if you stayed within:
  - safety limits,
  - power awareness,
  - evidence/assumption clarity,
- capture one or two changes for next time.

You can use the Recursion and Iteration template from Reference, or just answer:

- “What helped?”
- “What hurt?”
- “What will I change next time?”

When you use the same space more than once, treat it like versioned code:

- v1.0:
  - first working version,
- v1.1:
  - small tweaks,
- v2.0:
  - major redesign.

Over time you get a **library of spaces** that fit your real situations.

## Three common usage patterns

You do not have to use QSS the same way everywhere. These are three typical patterns.

### Solo reflection

Use for:

- role decisions,
- energy and burnout checks,
- personal direction questions,
- recurring conflict patterns.

Flow:

- use the personal reflection playbook,
- keep emotional focus on present and near-term future,
- set a timebox,
- always end with:
  - one small, realistic next step.

If reflection surfaces heavy content (despair, trauma, self-harm thoughts):

- treat that as a signal, not something QSS should dig into,
- consider talking to someone you trust or a professional.

### Pair / small group (2–5 people)

Use for:

- co-leads alignment,
- vendor–client sponsor check-ins,
- band decisions,
- manager–report conversations.

Flow:

- share a simplified Orientation aloud,
- agree on timebox and goals,
- keep a visible note of:
  - “we’re here to understand X and decide Y,”
- leave time at the end for Meta:
  - “How did this way of talking feel?”

Be especially careful with power:

- higher-power participants speak later,
- lower-power participants are never forced into emotional disclosure in front of their boss or client.

### Workshop / meeting (larger groups)

Use for:

- discovery workshops,
- retrospectives,
- strategy/roadmap sessions,
- cross-team alignment meetings.

Flow:

- design using Quickstart builder and domain playbooks,
- break work into segments:
  - small group, then share,
- keep Safety Check in mind:
  - avoid hot topics in mixed-power large rooms without preparation,
- use visual aids:
  - whiteboards,
  - sticky notes,
  - diagrams.

Always be clear:

- what this session will and will not do,
- what will happen with notes and outcomes.

## How to navigate this site

If you have:

- 10–20 minutes:
  - read this guide,
  - skim the Quickstart Builder,
  - copy one domain playbook and use it as is.
- 1–2 hours:
  - read Theory:
    - What is a Question Space,
    - Core architecture,
    - Dimensions of inquiry,
    - Modes and lifecycle.
  - then design one space for a real upcoming situation.
- ongoing use:
  - gradually build and version your own spaces,
  - extend the case studies with your own,
  - refine and localize question phrasing to your language and culture.

## Using QSS with AI agents

If you plan to use QSS as a backbone for an AI assistant:

- treat Orientation, Topology, Flow, and Safety Check as explicit fields,
- encode the Safety Check as a literal rule:
  - if Power Asymmetry is High and Safety is Low, avoid:
    - direct interrogation,
    - deep Emotion & Needs prompts toward low-power participants,
- keep:
  - modes,
  - dimensions,
  - and templates
  as structured data that the agent can pick from.

The same principle holds:

- the quality of answers is limited by the quality of:
  - Orientation,
  - dimensions chosen,
  - and safety boundaries.

QSS exists so that you do not improvise this every time.  
You can design question spaces once, then reuse and evolve them with each real situation you face.
