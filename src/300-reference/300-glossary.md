# Glossary

Short, practical definitions of terms used across the Question Space System (QSS).

You can skim this once or jump back here when something in Theory or Practice feels fuzzy.

## Core System Terms

### Question Space

A designed structure of inquiry for a specific situation.

A question space is:

- not just a list of questions,
- but a combination of:
  - Orientation (what this is for, for whom, under which constraints),
  - Topology (which dimensions of inquiry are active),
  - Flow (order, depth, branching, entry/exit),
  - Recursion (how the space learns from its own use).

It is always:

- context-specific,
- power-aware,
- and bounded in scope (not therapy, not legal or medical work, not emergency response).

### Question Space System (QSS)

The whole framework described in this repository:

- Theory:
  - concepts, architecture, dimensions, modes, patterns.
- Practice:
  - methods, quickstarts, domain playbooks.
- Reference:
  - glossary, templates, examples.

QSS is meant to help you:

- design,
- use,
- and evolve

your own question spaces for the domains you care about.

### Orientation

The explicit statement of:

- what this space is for,
- who it is for and who is affected,
- which mode you are in (Setup, Stabilization, Growth),
- how power and safety look,
- what is in scope and out of scope.

Orientation is the starting point for every serious question space.  
If Orientation is wrong, everything built on top of it is distorted.

### Topology

The choice of **which dimensions of inquiry** are active in a given space.

Examples:

- Clarification,
- Assumptions,
- Boundaries & Ownership,
- Emotion & Needs,
- Evidence & Uncertainty,
- Meta, and others.

Topology answers:

- “Which lenses do we apply here, and which do we deliberately leave out?”

### Flow

The ordered path through a question space:

- Entry:
  - how you begin.
- Sequence:
  - which dimensions you visit and in what order.
- Depth control:
  - how far you go in each dimension.
- Branching:
  - how you adapt to what emerges.
- Exit:
  - how you close and integrate.

Flow is where a topology becomes a usable conversation.

### Recursion

The space reflecting on itself.

In practice, recursion means:

- In-session Meta:
  - checking how the conversation is landing.
- Post-session review:
  - noting what worked, what didn’t.
- Pattern-level iteration:
  - updating the design, versioning spaces over time.

Recursion turns QSS into a learning system instead of a fixed set of scripts.

### Mode

The overall stance of a question space relative to the situation:

- Setup:
  - designing or initiating something before it breaks.
- Stabilization:
  - repairing or stabilizing a situation that is slipping or tense.
- Growth:
  - deepening, optimizing, or expanding something that basically works.

Mode strongly influences which dimensions and flows are appropriate.

### Context

The real-world situation the space is applied to:

- domain:
  - work, consulting, personal, creative, etc.
- stakes:
  - low, medium, high.
- time constraints:
  - quick chat vs workshop vs self-reflection.
- format:
  - 1:1, group, async, written, live.

Context is captured during intake and summarized in Orientation.

### Participant

Any person or role that takes part in or is directly affected by the question space.

Examples:

- client sponsor, vendor PM, tech lead, team members, band members, yourself.

Participants can have different levels of power, risk, and ability to speak freely.

### Power and Safety

Short-hand for:

- who has more formal or informal authority,
- who is more exposed to risk (job, contract, reputation, health),
- how safe it is to speak honestly in this space.

QSS treats power and safety as **structural facts**, not personal flaws.  
They affect:

- which questions are safe to ask,
- how Emotion & Needs is phrased,
- and how Meta questions are used.

### Scope and Limits

The boundaries of what a question space is meant to handle.

QSS is designed for:

- reflection,
- alignment,
- sense-making,
- decision support in work and creative contexts.

QSS is not designed for:

- emergency situations,
- diagnosis or treatment (medical or mental health),
- legal advice or disputes,
- deep therapeutic processing of trauma.

When a space touches these areas, the responsible move is to:

- stop or lighten the inquiry,
- and consider redirecting to appropriate support.

## Dimensions of Inquiry

These are the main “lenses” you can activate in a topology.

### Clarification

Goal:

- align on meaning and basic facts.

Used for:

- “What are we even talking about?”
- “What problem are we trying to solve?”

Typical questions:

- “In your own words, what is this about?”
- “What does this term mean to you?”

### Assumptions

Goal:

- surface what is taken for granted but not stated.

Used for:

- uncovering hidden expectations,
- explaining repeated surprises or disappointments.

Typical questions:

- “What were you expecting that we never said out loud?”
- “What are we treating as fixed that might not be?”

### Boundaries and Ownership

Goal:

- define scope, responsibilities, and decision rights.

Used for:

- clarifying who decides what,
- reducing “work that falls between chairs”,
- limiting over-responsibility.

Typical questions:

- “Who owns this decision?”
- “Where do handoffs feel risky or unclear?”

### Value and Impact

Goal:

- understand what matters and for whom.

Used for:

- aligning priorities,
- making trade-offs visible.

Typical questions:

- “Who is most affected if this goes well or badly?”
- “What does success look like, and for whom?”

### Emotional and Relational Field / Needs

Goal:

- make the felt experience and basic needs visible enough to design responsibly.

Used for:

- situations with tension, fatigue, enthusiasm, or fear,
- aligning collaboration with human needs.

Constraints:

- stays in the context of this work/relationship/creative project and near future,
- avoids deep clinical or therapeutic work.

Typical questions:

- “How does this collaboration feel right now?”
- “Which of your needs are clearly met or not met here?”

### Contrast and Alternatives

Goal:

- compare options and highlight trade-offs.

Used for:

- avoiding false binaries,
- mapping different plausible paths.

Typical questions:

- “What are the main paths we see?”
- “What does each path give and cost us?”

### Causality and Consequence

Goal:

- connect causes and effects, especially in recurring patterns.

Used for:

- understanding why certain dynamics repeat,
- anticipating consequences of choices.

Typical questions:

- “What usually happens next when this pattern starts?”
- “If we choose this option, what likely chain of events follows?”

### Layering / Abstraction

Goal:

- move between levels of detail and system views.

Used for:

- keeping conversations from getting stuck in tiny details or vague generalities.

Typical questions:

- “At the high level, what are we trying to do?”
- “Can you give one concrete example of that?”

### Temporal

Goal:

- use time as a lens (past, present, future).

Used for:

- spotting trends,
- imagining consequences,
- extracting lessons.

Typical questions:

- “When did this start?”
- “If nothing changes in six or twelve months, how will that feel?”

### Evidence and Uncertainty

Goal:

- distinguish what is known from what is guessed,
- gauge confidence and risk.

Used for:

- any decision with stakes,
- correcting overconfident narratives.

Typical questions:

- “What do we actually know from data or experience?”
- “What are we assuming, and how could we be wrong?”
- “What experiment would reduce our uncertainty?”

### Meta / Reflexive

Goal:

- reflect on the space itself and how it is working.

Used for:

- recursion,
- co-steering the conversation.

Typical questions:

- “What feels useful or not useful about this conversation?”
- “Have we named the real issue, or are we circling?”

## Patterns and Flows

### Shallow Pass

A first light pass over multiple dimensions:

- one or two questions per dimension,
- to see where the energy or problem really is.

Often followed by a deep dive into one or two dimensions.

### Deep Dive

Focused exploration of a specific dimension:

- used after a shallow pass reveals where the leverage is,
- or when entering a space with a very clear problem area.

### Branching Flow

A flow with conditional paths:

- Core trunk:
  - a few questions you always ask.
- Branches:
  - additional questions you use only if certain signals appear:
    - strong disagreement,
    - visible frustration,
    - conflicting facts.

### Ladder Flow

A deliberate alternation between:

- abstract questions (principles, patterns, big picture),
- concrete questions (examples, specific incidents).

Used to avoid getting stuck at only one level.

### Funnel Flow

A pattern that moves from:

- wide exploration of values and options,
- through analysis of consequences and evidence,
- toward narrower commitment and next steps.

## Modes in Practice

### Setup Mode

You are:

- designing or initiating something new,
- trying to prevent obvious misalignment,
- setting expectations and boundaries.

Key dimensions often include:

- Clarification,
- Assumptions,
- Boundaries & Ownership,
- Value & Impact,
- Evidence & Uncertainty.

### Stabilization Mode

You are:

- dealing with drift, conflict, or tension,
- trying to stop things from getting worse,
- aiming for small stabilizing moves.

Key dimensions often include:

- Clarification,
- Temporal,
- Assumptions,
- Boundaries & Ownership,
- Emotion & Needs,
- Value & Impact,
- Evidence & Uncertainty.

### Growth Mode

You are:

- improving something that already basically works,
- exploring options and trade-offs,
- designing experiments or long-term direction.

Key dimensions often include:

- Value & Impact,
- Contrast & Alternatives,
- Temporal,
- Causality & Consequence,
- Layering,
- Evidence & Uncertainty,
- Meta.

## Domain-Specific Terms (as used in Playbooks)

These are not universal definitions; they are how QSS uses them in the domain playbooks.

### Client–Vendor Engagement

Any relationship where:

- one party buys or commissions work,
- the other delivers services or products.

In QSS:

- often a focus area for Setup and Stabilization spaces,
- with explicit attention to power, contracts, and expectations.

### DevEx (Developer Experience)

The lived experience of engineers in an organization:

- tools,
- processes,
- culture,
- cognitive load,
- ability to do good work without excessive friction.

In QSS:

- often a Growth-mode topic in delivery/consulting playbooks.

### Band Identity

The shared sense of:

- what a band or musical project sounds like,
- what it stands for,
- what listeners can expect.

In QSS:

- a focus area for creative Growth-mode spaces (music playbook).

### Mixing Direction

The deliberate choice of:

- sonic aesthetic,
- balance between raw/live vs polished/studio,
- intended listening context.

In QSS:

- often explored via Contrast & Alternatives, Value & Impact, Emotion & Needs.

## Safety and Ethics

### Emotional Scope

The intended depth of emotional exploration:

- present-focused,
- context-bound (work, collaboration, creative project),
- near-term future.

QSS does not aim to process:

- deep childhood history,
- trauma,
- or clinical conditions.

### Red Flags

Signals that QSS should step back and other support should step in:

- risk of harm or self-harm,
- serious health symptoms,
- legal threats or disputes,
- abuse or harassment.

When these appear, the appropriate move is to:

- pause or limit the question space,
- acknowledge the weight,
- suggest or seek more suitable help.

You do not need to memorize any of this.

The glossary is here so that when a term appears in Theory, Practice, or examples, you can quickly:

- check what it means in this system,
- and decide how you want to adapt it in your own Question Space System.
