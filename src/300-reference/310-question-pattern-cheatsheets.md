# Question Pattern Cheatsheets

This file is meant as a grab-and-go reference.

You already know the ideas from Theory and Practice.  
Here you get **ready-made question patterns** grouped by:

- Dimension cheatsheets (Clarification, Assumptions, etc.)
- Mode cheatsheets (Setup, Stabilization, Growth)
- Micro-patterns (entries, meta, closures, safety pivots)

Use it to:

- draft a space quickly,
- adjust phrasing on the fly,
- or un-stick a stalled conversation.

You are expected to adapt wording to your own voice.

## Dimension Cheatsheets

Each dimension has:

- Light – low-intensity, safe in most contexts
- Standard – typical usage
- Deep – only when trust, time, and scope allow
- Power-aware tweaks – for strong hierarchy / risk

### Clarification

Goal: align on “what we’re talking about” and basic facts.

Light:

- “In your own words, what is this about?”
- “If you had to explain this in one sentence to a colleague, what would you say?”
- “What decision or problem is actually on the table right now?”

Standard:

- “What is happening, from your perspective?”
- “What would you say is inside the scope of this discussion, and what is clearly outside?”
- “What has already been tried so far?”

Deep:

- “If we rewound to the start of this situation, what would we describe differently than we did back then?”
- “What parts of this are noise, and what is the real signal we should focus on?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Emphasize perspective:
  - “From your vantage point, what does this look like?”
- Avoid framing someone as “wrong” from the start:
  - use “different views” instead of “misunderstandings”.

When to avoid:

- When people are in clear distress; start with emotional safety first.

### Assumptions

Goal: surface expectations and beliefs that were never stated.

Light:

- “What were you expecting would happen here?”
- “What did you assume the other side would do?”
- “What did you assume you would get from this?”

Standard:

- “Which expectations did we never actually say out loud?”
- “What are we treating as fixed that might not be?”
- “What story are we telling ourselves about why the other side behaves like this?”

Deep:

- “If your main assumptions were wrong, what would change in how you see this situation?”
- “Which assumptions are protecting you from discomfort, and which are actually helping you see clearly?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Own your side first:
  - “Here’s what I realized I was assuming. What about you?”
- Use “we” and “our” more than “you” when power is unequal.

When to avoid:

- When someone is being blamed in front of their boss; start with Clarification and Value first.

### Boundaries and Ownership

Goal: clarify who owns what and where responsibilities begin and end.

Light:

- “Who is supposed to decide this?”
- “Where does your responsibility end in this process?”
- “Where do you see the riskiest handoffs?”

Standard:

- “For each of these areas, who owns decisions, who executes, and who needs to be informed?”
- “Are there decisions that both sides think they own?”
- “Is there anything important that currently nobody clearly owns?”

Deep:

- “Where are you carrying responsibility that was never formally given to you?”
- “What would a healthier boundary look like here, in concrete terms?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Invite shared ownership:
  - “Let’s map responsibilities, not blame. I’ll start with what I think I own.”
- Be careful not to turn this into “who failed”; keep it about design of roles.

When to avoid:

- When legal responsibility is actively disputed; switch to legal/contract processes.

### Value and Impact

Goal: understand what matters, for whom, and why.

Light:

- “Who is most affected by this?”
- “What would a good outcome look like for you?”
- “What do you really want from this situation?”

Standard:

- “If we cannot get everything, what is most important to protect?”
- “Whose success are we optimizing for here?”
- “What would make this clearly worth the effort for you?”

Deep:

- “If you look three to five years ahead, what impact do you hope this choice will have?”
- “What impact do you fear it could have if it goes badly?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Center their interests when you hold more power:
  - “From your side, what outcome would make this feel worthwhile?”
- Validate multiple stakeholders:
  - “I know this affects not just you, but also X and Y. How do you weigh those?”

When to avoid:

- Almost never; but in acute crisis, safety and stabilization come first.

### Emotional and Relational Field / Needs

Goal: acknowledge how the situation feels and what basic needs are affected, within context and scope.

Light:

- “Right now, does this setup feel more supportive or more draining for you?”
- “What has been most frustrating or tiring about this?”
- “What keeps you still engaged here, despite the difficulties?”

Standard:

- “Which of your needs feel met in this collaboration (for example, respect, clarity, belonging, autonomy)? Which do not?”
- “Was there a moment where your trust dipped? What happened?”
- “What would make this feel more sustainable or respectful for you?”

Deep:

- “What have you been holding back saying about how this feels?”
- “What is this situation doing to your energy and confidence over time?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Shift to system language:
  - “What about our setup makes it harder for you to do good work?”
- Start with yourself if you have power:
  - “Here is where I think my actions may have made this feel worse. I’d like to hear how this has been for you.”

When to avoid:

- When discussion is sliding into trauma, self-harm, or deep family issues:
  - acknowledge, then redirect to more appropriate support.

### Contrast and Alternatives

Goal: lay out options and see trade-offs more clearly.

Light:

- “What are the main options you see right now?”
- “If we name two extremes, what are they?”
- “What is the ‘safe’ path and what is the ‘bold’ path?”

Standard:

- “For each option, what do we gain and what do we lose?”
- “Which option gives the best trade-off between risk and impact, given our constraints?”
- “Is there a hybrid or third option we are ignoring?”

Deep:

- “If we imagine that all options fail, which failure do we prefer?”
- “Which option would we choose if we optimized for long-term integrity rather than short-term comfort?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Ask them to define options first, especially if you hold power:
  - “Before I share my view, what options do you see?”
- Avoid pushing your preferred option as a “neutral question”.

When to avoid:

- When people are in acute distress and need stabilization more than choice architecture.

### Causality and Consequence

Goal: make cause–effect chains and likely outcomes explicit.

Light:

- “What usually happens next when this pattern starts?”
- “What do you think this decision will change in the next few weeks?”
- “Who will notice the impact first?”

Standard:

- “What is the most plausible chain of events if we continue as we are?”
- “If we choose option A, walk me through the likely next three steps.”
- “What unintended consequences should we be watching for?”

Deep:

- “If this pattern continues for a year, what does the system look like then?”
- “What structural forces are keeping this pattern in place?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Talk about systems, not individuals:
  - “How does our current process produce this outcome, even when people are trying their best?”

When to avoid:

- When someone is being blamed for systemic issues; first reframe the problem at system level.

### Layering / Abstraction

Goal: move flexibly between detail and big picture.

Light:

- “At a high level, what are we trying to do here?”
- “Can you give one concrete example of that?”
- “Is this a local issue or a pattern you see in many places?”

Standard:

- “How does this specific situation reflect something larger in our system?”
- “If we fix this incident but not the pattern, what happens?”

Deep:

- “At which level should we actually intervene: individual, team, process, organization, ecosystem?”
- “What would change if we shifted this one level up or down?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Use layering to protect individuals:
  - “Instead of focusing on this person, can we describe the pattern they’re caught in?”

When to avoid:

- When people are overwhelmed; too much zooming can feel abstract and evasive.

### Temporal

Goal: use time (past, present, future) to understand and design.

Light:

- “When did this start?”
- “What has changed since then?”
- “If nothing changes for the next six months, how do you expect to feel?”

Standard:

- “Looking back, when did things feel most ‘right’? What was true then?”
- “If this goes well in one to three years, what is true?”
- “If it goes badly, what is the plausible ‘bad case’?”

Deep:

- “Which decisions in the past created the current constraints?”
- “What future are we silently committing to if we keep our current habits?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Avoid using the past to blame; use it to learn:
  - “Given what we know now, what would we do differently next time?”

When to avoid:

- When someone is stuck in regret loops; stay closer to present and near-future steps.

### Evidence and Uncertainty

Goal: separate what is known from what is guessed, and assess confidence.

Light:

- “What do we actually know about this?”
- “What are we assuming?”
- “How confident are we, roughly, on a scale from 1 to 10?”

Standard:

- “What data, history, or concrete examples support this view?”
- “Where are we acting as if we know, but really we’re guessing?”
- “What experiment or test could reduce our uncertainty?”

Deep:

- “Where are we clinging to a story because it’s comfortable, despite weak evidence?”
- “If we had to bet our own money or reputation on this assumption, would we still hold it?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Avoid turning this into cross-examination of lower-power people:
  - focus on shared assumptions:
    - “What are we, as a group, treating as fact without proof?”

When to avoid:

- When evidence depends on medical, legal, or clinical expertise you don’t have; recognize limits and involve appropriate professionals.

### Meta / Reflexive

Goal: let the conversation reflect on itself and adjust.

Light:

- “How is this conversation landing so far?”
- “What has been most useful so far? Least useful?”
- “Is there anything we’re avoiding talking about?”

Standard:

- “Did any question feel unfair or unsafe?”
- “Have we named the real issue, or are we still circling?”
- “What should we do differently if we run a similar conversation again?”

Deep:

- “What does our difficulty talking about this reveal about our system?”
- “What kind of conversations do we never allow ourselves to have?”

Power-aware tweaks:

- Start by owning your side:
  - “Has my way of asking questions helped or made this harder?”
- Give explicit permission to critique the space:
  - “It’s okay if you say this wasn’t helpful; that’s data.”

When to avoid:

- Rarely needed; but don’t overdo Meta in crisis moments—people may need concrete support more than process reflection.

## Micro-Pattern Cheatsheets

Fast patterns you can drop into any space.

### Entry patterns

Neutral:

- “Can we each give a one-sentence version of what we think this is about?”
- “Before we dive in, what outcome would make this time well spent for you?”

Tense situations:

- “I can see this is not easy. Before we try to fix anything, can we first make sure we see the situation in a similar way?”
- “I’d like to understand how this has been for you, in your own words.”

Solo reflection:

- “What do I need this time to help me with?”
- “If this reflection went well, what would I walk away clearer about?”

### Pivot patterns (when things go sideways)

Too emotional / hot:

- “This feels intense. Let’s pause for a moment.  
  What part of this is most important to keep talking about, and what can wait?”

Too abstract:

- “Can we anchor this in one concrete recent example?”
- “Where did this show up last week?”

Too detailed / in the weeds:

- “If we zoom out, what is the bigger pattern this example belongs to?”
- “At the highest level, what are we actually trying to achieve?”

### Meta patterns

Mid-session check:

- “Is this line of questioning still helpful, or do we need to shift?”
- “Have we named the real issue, or are we still circling around it?”

End-session check:

- “What feels clearer now?”
- “What is still foggy?”
- “What is one next step you are willing to take, based on this?”

### Safety and scope patterns

When you hit something out-of-scope (medical, legal, deep trauma):

- “This sounds heavier than what this space is designed to hold.”
- “I don’t want to pretend questions alone can handle this.  
  It might be better to talk to [doctor / therapist / lawyer / HR / trusted person] about that part.”
- “We can stay with the work/creative context here, and treat the other part as a separate concern.”

When you sense distress:

- “I’m noticing this is bringing up a lot.  
  Do you want to keep going a bit, slow down, or pause and pick this up another time?”
- “We don’t have to answer everything today.  
  What feels safe enough to stay with, and what should we park for now?”

### “One small step” patterns

Use these to land the space in action.

Work/consulting:

- “Given everything we discussed, what is one small change we can test in the next one to two weeks?”
- “What will we stop doing immediately because it clearly makes things worse?”

Personal reflection:

- “What is one low-risk step I can take this week that respects what I learned here?”
- “What conversation do I need to schedule, and with whom?”

Music/creative:

- “What is one specific change we’ll try in the next rehearsal/mix?”
- “What do we want to listen for after we make that change?”

You do not have to use these verbatim.

The point of these cheatsheets is to give you **shapes and starting points** so you can design and adapt question spaces quickly, without losing:

- orientation,
- power-awareness,
- emotional scope,
- and a clear way to land in the next step.
