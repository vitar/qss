# Example Question Spaces and Case Studies

This file shows **full examples** of question spaces in action.

Each example includes:

- Context snapshot – what was going on.
- Orientation – how the space was defined.
- Topology – which dimensions were chosen and why.
- Flow sketch – how the conversation actually unfolded.
- Recursion notes – what was learned and how the space changed.

Treat these as worked examples you can adapt, not universal recipes.

## Case 1 – Client–Vendor Reset for a Slipping Fixed-Bid Project

### Context snapshot

- Domain: software delivery, consulting.
- Situation:
  - Fixed-bid project, mid-way through.
  - Delivery slipping; client threatening escalation but not yet cancelling.
  - Vendor team tired; client sponsor under pressure from their leadership.
- Format: 60-minute remote call, client and vendor leaders only.
- Stakes: high (reputation, budget, relationship).

### Orientation

“In this Stabilization situation, with the client holding commercial power and the vendor under delivery and margin pressure,  
I want this space to help us:

- get a shared picture of what has been happening,
- surface expectations and boundaries,
- and agree on one or two stabilizing changes,

in a way that is honest but non-blaming,  
within a 60-minute joint call, staying in work context (no legal negotiation, no therapy).”

Cognitive goals:

- shared understanding of drift causes,
- agreement on minimal reset actions.

Relational goals:

- de-escalate tension,
- restore some sense of predictability.

### Topology

Chosen dimensions:

- Clarification – necessary; both sides have different stories.
- Temporal – to pinpoint when things went off.
- Assumptions – hidden expectations are driving frustration.
- Boundaries & Ownership – unclear roles on scope/timeline decisions.
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs – frustration and fatigue are visible.
- Value & Impact – to anchor on what still matters most.
- Evidence & Uncertainty – to separate stories from facts.
- Meta / Reflexive – to adjust in the moment and check usefulness.

Why this set:

- Stabilization mode → this is the “standard” stabilization topology.
- Emotion is not optional; but phrased at collaboration level, not personal therapy.
- Evidence is needed because both sides have “we always…” narratives.

### Flow sketch (what actually happened)

Entry – Clarification

- Q: “From your perspective, what has been happening with this project over the last six weeks?”  
  Client speaks first; vendor listens and reflects back.
- Q: “From our side, here is how the last six weeks looked. What’s different or missing?”

Result:

- Two different timelines appear (client focusing on missed milestones; vendor focusing on dependency delays).

Temporal and assumptions

- Q: “If you look back, when did this start to feel ‘off’ for you?”  
  Client points to a mid-project scope extension; vendor points to an internal client re-org.
- Q: “At those moments, what were you expecting we would do? What did you think we expected from you?”

Result:

- Client assumed vendor would absorb scope with minor adjustment.
- Vendor assumed client would extend timeline before approving extra scope.

Boundaries and ownership

- Q: “Who did we think owned:
  - scope change approvals,
  - timeline changes,
  - cutting or deferring requirements?”
- Q: “Are there decisions that both of us thought we owned?”

Result:

- Scope decisions effectively had no clear owner; both parties thought the other would concede.

Emotion and needs (context-limited)

- Q: “How does this collaboration feel for you right now: more predictable or more draining?”  
  Client: “draining and unpredictable.”  
  Vendor: “tense and reactive.”
- Q: “What would need to change for this to feel workable again over the next month or two?”

Result:

- Client needs predictability and fewer last-minute surprises.
- Vendor needs clearer decisions and realistic trade-offs.

Evidence and uncertainty

- Q: “What do we actually know from data or events about:
  - how much scope increased,
  - when key decisions were made,
  - where time was lost?”
- Q: “Where are we guessing or blaming without data?”

Result:

- A few concrete facts surface:
  - ~25% scope increase with no timeline change.
  - Multiple weeks lost awaiting approvals.
- Both admit to narratives that weren’t fully grounded.

Value and impact

- Q: “Given where we are, what’s most important to protect:
  - the ultimate feature list,
  - the original date,
  - relationship and future work,
  - or team sustainability?”
- Q: “If we cannot have everything, what are you most willing to trade off?”

Result:

- Client: willing to trim scope; very sensitive to losing credibility on date.
- Vendor: willing to push harder in short term if scope is reduced and change rules are clear.

Exit – minimal reset and Meta

- Q: “What one or two concrete changes can we commit to for the next four weeks?”
  - Joint decision:
    - scope triage workshop within one week,
    - clear RACI for scope and timeline changes,
    - weekly 30-minute “no surprises” sync.
- Q: “What felt useful about this conversation, and what should we adjust next time?”

Result:

- Client: “This is the first time I feel we’re actually talking about the real issues, not just status.”
- Vendor: “We should have done this earlier; we were avoiding hard scope conversations.”

### Recursion notes

What worked:

- Early multi-perspective Clarification exposed divergent timelines without blame.
- Emotion & Needs, phrased around collaboration, helped name fatigue safely.
- Boundaries segment revealed “no owner” decisions.

What felt off:

- Time pressure: Evidence & Uncertainty felt rushed.
- The session almost drifted into renegotiation of contract terms.

Space changes (v1.1):

- For future escalations:
  - Add a very brief “contract is not being renegotiated here” scope statement in Orientation.
  - Move Value & Impact earlier so reset actions are anchored faster.
  - Prepare a one-page visual timeline beforehand to save time in Clarification.

The space evolved from:

- “Escalation Reset v1.0”
to
- “Escalation Reset – Scope and Stability v1.1”.

## Case 2 – Internal Team Retro After a Rough Release

### Context snapshot

- Domain: internal software team.
- Situation:
  - Release caused late nights, bugs, and internal tension.
  - Standard retros drift into “we should communicate more” without change.
- Format: 45-minute retro, whole team + manager.
- Stakes: medium (team morale, future releases).

### Orientation

“In this Stabilization retro, with the team tired but still functioning,  
I want this space to help us understand what made this release painful,  
and agree on one or two changes that make the next release less brutal,  
within 45 minutes, staying on team processes and behaviors (no performance reviews, no personal attacks).”

Cognitive goals:

- identify one or two structural causes,
- design minimal process changes.

Relational goals:

- legitimize people’s tiredness,
- avoid blame spirals.

### Topology

Dimensions:

- Clarification – avoid vague “bad release” talk.
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs – burnout risk; must be visible.
- Assumptions – mismatch on expectations.
- Boundaries & Ownership – unclear decisions around scope and testing.
- Evidence & Uncertainty – distinguish actual incidents from perceptions.
- Value & Impact – re-anchor on what matters next time.
- Meta – small review at end.

### Flow sketch (key moments)

Clarification

- Q: “In one or two sentences each, what made this release ‘rough’ for you?”  
  Team members share short statements:
  - “constant scope changes,”
  - “nightly fixes,”
  - “unrealistic date.”
- Facilitator clusters themes on a board: scope volatility, late testing, last-minute decisions.

Emotion & Needs

- Q: “On a scale 1–10, how supported did you feel during this release?”  
  Numbers cluster around 4–6.
- Q: “What is one thing that made this number lower than you’d like?”  
  Answers:
  - unplanned weekend work,
  - unclear priority changes,
  - lack of backup.

Assumptions

- Q: “What did you expect others would do that they did not do (and we never explicitly agreed on)?”  
  Examples:
  - devs expected PMs to reject late scope,
  - PMs expected devs to push back sooner.

Boundaries & Ownership

- Q: “For scope changes inside the last two weeks before release, who owns accept/reject decisions?”  
  Silence → realization that nobody was explicit owner.
- Q: “Who decides to slip date vs cut scope?”
  - Team assumed “business”.
  - Manager assumed “joint” but hadn’t set a clear rule.

Evidence & Uncertainty

- Q: “How many scope changes landed after code freeze date?”  
  They check board: multiple.
- Q: “How many incidents did we actually ship to production?”  
  Fewer than the emotional memory suggested; intensity was due to timing and tiredness.

Value & Impact

- Q: “For the next release, what matters most:
  - fewer nights/weekend work,
  - fewer incidents,
  - more predictable scope?”
- They choose:
  - more predictable scope,
  - fewer nights/weekends.

Exit & Meta

- Q: “One concrete change we will try in our next release?”  
  They agree on:
  - “last-two-weeks change gate” with explicit owner,
  - “no weekend work” rule without manager approval.
- Q: “What about this retro felt different, if anything?”  
  Team: more specific, less vague “communication” talk.

### Recursion notes

What worked:

- Emotion scaled via simple 1–10 made it safe to talk about support without long stories.
- Explicit mapping of decision owners turned vague frustration into concrete change.

What felt off:

- Some quieter team members still spoke less; power dynamics within team persisted.

Space changes (v1.1):

- Add a written pre-step where people list:
  - “what helped,”
  - “what hurt,”
  - “one rule for next time.”
- Use anonymous input for sensitive parts if needed.

Space evolved from:

- “Rough Release Retro v1.0”
to
- “Rough Release Retro – Scope & Support v1.1”.

## Case 3 – Personal Role Decision: Stay, Shift, or Leave

### Context snapshot

- Domain: personal reflection, career.
- Situation:
  - Senior engineer/lead is considering staying in current role, shifting role internally, or leaving.
  - Not in immediate crisis; more of a long, low-grade tension and curiosity.
- Format: solo 45-minute journaling session.
- Stakes: medium-high (career direction, energy, finances).

### Orientation

“In this Growth-ish personal situation, where I’m considering staying, shifting, or leaving my current role,  
I want this space to help me understand how my current path aligns with my values, energy, and plausible futures,  
and to decide on one small, honest next step,  
in a 45-minute written reflection, staying within work/career and not trying to resolve my entire life story.”

Cognitive goals:

- distill key fit/misfit points,
- sketch plausible futures.

Relational (with self) goals:

- be honest without self-attack,
- end with a concrete next step, not just rumination.

### Topology

Dimensions:

- Value & Impact – what the user wants from work.
- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs – how current role actually feels.
- Temporal – past “good fits” and plausible futures.
- Evidence & Uncertainty – what’s known vs guessed about options.
- Boundaries & Ownership – what is theirs to change vs not.
- Meta – short reflection at end.

### Flow sketch (how it was used)

Value & Impact

- Prompt:
  - “What do I want my work to give me in the next two to three years?”
- Writes about:
  - learning and craft,
  - authentic impact on people and systems,
  - enough stability to experiment.

Emotion & Needs

- Prompt:
  - “On most weeks, does this role feel more energizing or draining? Where exactly?”
- Identifies:
  - energized by mentoring, systems thinking, and deep technical work.
  - drained by repetitive administrative tasks and misaligned engagements.
- Needs:
  - autonomy, respect for expertise, meaningful client problems.

Temporal

- Past:
  - “When did I last feel ‘this is exactly where I should be’?”  
    Writes about a project with high trust and clear mandate.
- Future:
  - “If I stay and things go reasonably well, what is true?”  
  - “If I shift internally?”  
  - “If I leave and go independent later?”

Evidence & Uncertainty

- Known:
  - current org can sometimes provide aligned projects, but not consistently.
  - financial runway is limited; abrupt exit is risky.
- Assumed:
  - “Other companies will be more aligned,”
  - “Independence means more creative work.”
- Prompt:
  - “What small experiment could test these assumptions?”  
  Ideas:
  - informal conversations with people in target roles,
  - small side projects or consulting tests.

Boundaries & Ownership

- Prompt:
  - “What do I own here?”  
    Conversations to start, topics to propose, boundaries on overload.
  - “What does the org own?”  
    Structure, sales model, incentive systems.
- Realization:
  - some misalignment is structural and unlikely to change soon.

Exit & Meta

- Prompt:
  - “What feels clearer now?”  
    Clearer that the question is not immediate exit vs stay, but:
    - “How do I prepare for more alignment in 6–18 months?”
  - “What is one small step in the next week?”
    - Plan: schedule a conversation to explore internal shifts,
    - plus define one small external experiment (writing, framing services, portfolio).

### Recursion notes

What worked:

- The Temporal layer helped distinguish temporary discomfort from structural misfit.
- Evidence & Uncertainty prevented premature romanticizing of alternatives.

What felt off:

- Some emotion around identity and fear surfaced that was heavier than the current scope; needed to pause and not dive deeper.

Space changes (v1.1):

- Add an explicit Safety note:
  - “If this reflection brings up strong distress or despair, pause and consider external support.”
- Add a small “identity question” in a controlled way:
  - “What kind of person do I hope I’m becoming through my work?”

## Case 4 – Live Album Mix Direction: Raw vs Polished

### Context snapshot

- Domain: music production.
- Situation:
  - Band has a multitrack recording of a strong live gig.
  - Debating whether to keep it raw and gig-like or make it closer to a studio album.
- Format: 60-minute listening session plus 30-minute discussion.
- Stakes: medium (artistic identity, band satisfaction, listener reception).

### Orientation

“In this Growth creative situation, where we are deciding how to present our live recording,  
I want this space to help us choose a direction on the raw ↔ polished spectrum that fits our identity, listeners, and realistic constraints,  
in a way that feels respectful to performances and honest about what we want,  
within a 90-minute band session, staying within music/production choices (no career ultimatums, no personal attacks).”

Cognitive goals:

- decide on mix direction and constraints.

Relational goals:

- surface hidden preferences,
- avoid someone quietly hating the final sound.

### Topology

Dimensions:

- Contrast & Alternatives – raw vs polished, plus hybrids.
- Value & Impact – what they want listeners to feel.
- Emotional & Needs – how each direction feels to band members.
- Causality & Consequence – future effects on gigs, expectations.
- Evidence & Uncertainty – history of audience reactions.
- Layering – song-level vs album-level vs identity.
- Meta – reflection at the end.

### Flow sketch (how the conversation ran)

Contrast & Alternatives

- Listen to:
  - a raw-ish rough mix,
  - a more processed test mix,
  - two reference live albums (one raw, one polished).
- Q: “If we name the ‘raw’ direction and the ‘studio’ direction, how would we describe each in our own words?”

Value & Impact

- Q: “What do we most want listeners to feel with this album?”  
  Responses:
  - “like they’re at the gig,”
  - “like we’re better than a casual phone video,”
  - “like we’re a real band worth booking.”
- Q: “Which matters more for this project:
  - documenting this specific night,
  - or having a calling-card record that represents us?”

Emotion & Needs

- Q: “How do you personally feel listening to the rougher mix?”  
  Mixed responses:
  - drummer loves energy,
  - vocalist anxious about imperfections.
- Q: “How do you feel with the more polished version?”  
  Mixed responses:
  - bassist feels it loses some danger,
  - guitarist likes tighter punch.

Causality & Consequence

- Q: “If we commit to a more polished direction, what happens to:
  - expectations for future gigs,
  - workload for mixing,
  - our own enjoyment?”
- Q: “If we commit to a more raw direction, what happens to:
  - perception by bookers,
  - listenability on playlists,
  - how we feel about mistakes?”

Evidence & Uncertainty

- Q: “What do we know from audience reactions at shows?”  
  They recall comments about energy and crowd interaction, not perfection.
- Q: “Any feedback from previous recordings?”  
  People liked authenticity but sometimes struggled with clarity in noisy environments.
- Q: “What could we test quickly?”  
  Idea:
  - prepare two versions of one song (raw-leaning and polished-leaning),
  - share privately with small trusted group.

Layering

- Q: “Are there songs that want more polish and others that can stay messier?”  
  They identify:
  - more melodic songs for extra polish,
  - high-energy rockers for raw treatment.
- Q: “At album level, what arc do we want between these?”

Exit & Meta

- Decision:
  - 70/30 direction:
    - overall fidelity and clarity improved,
    - keep count-ins, crowd, some imperfections,
    - only fix clearly painful performance issues.
- Q: “What about this conversation do we want to remember for future records?”  
  Answer:
  - to decide intent early,
  - to design references and constraints before deep mixing.

### Recursion notes

What worked:

- Contrast & Alternatives with listening examples made abstract debate concrete.
- Emotion & Needs showed where specific members needed reassurance or compromise.

What felt off:

- Time management; they almost drifted into detailed track-by-track decisions.

Space changes (v1.1):

- Add a constraint:
  - “No more than 15 minutes discussing specific technical moves; keep focus on direction.”
- Add a pre-step:
  - each member writes a one-sentence “headline review” of the album they want.

The space evolved from:

- “Live Mix Direction v1.0”
to
- “Live Mix Direction – Identity First v1.1”.

---

These four examples are starting points.

As you build your own Question Space System, you’ll gradually create:

- your own case files,
- with Orientation, Topology, Flow, and Recursion notes,

tailored to your specific domains, relationships, and style.

This file can grow into a **personal case library** where you capture:

- “spaces that worked,”
- “spaces that failed and why,”
- and “spaces that changed how I think.”
