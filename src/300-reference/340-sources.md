# Sources and Inspirations

This system is intentionally **personal** and **synthetic**.

It is not a formal academic framework and it does not implement any single external method “by the book”.  
Instead, it draws from:

- your own prior frameworks,
- a cluster of adjacent disciplines and practices,
- and patterns that repeatedly proved useful in real situations.

This file documents those influences so it’s clear:

- what QSS is standing on,
- what it is not claiming to be,
- and where further reading or attribution might be appropriate.

## Purpose of this file

- Make intellectual lineage visible and honest.
- Avoid unintentional plagiarism or “mystery origins”.
- Give you anchors if you want to:
  - credit inspirations in public materials,
  - deepen specific lines of thinking later,
  - or point others to related work (“if you like QSS, you might also explore…”).

This is a **living list**.  
You can extend it as you notice new connections.

## Primary Internal Sources

These are your own frameworks and artifacts that QSS is most directly shaped by.

### Human Cooperation System (HCS)

Influence:

- Orientation:
  - attention to conditions, needs, functions, and modes.
- Explicit power and safety awareness.
- Focus on system modes:
  - Setup,
  - Stabilization,
  - Growth,
  - Conflict/Reset (QSS currently uses the first three explicitly).
- Function-first thinking:
  - “What function are we trying to restore or enable?”

Echoes in QSS:

- Mode model (Setup / Stabilization / Growth).
- Emphasis on conditions (emotional, relational, structural) as part of Orientation.
- Recursion as a system-maintaining function, not just a “nice extra”.

### 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)

Influence:

- Multi-sided view:
  - client, vendor, product/value relationships.
- Contract/tool thinking:
  - engagement patterns, boundary agreements, decision clarity.
- Maturity and state tracking:
  - where a project sits on axes like value, flow, shared ownership.

Echoes in QSS:

- Boundaries & Ownership dimension.
- Value & Impact as a first-class dimension rather than implicit.
- Domain playbooks for software delivery and consulting.

### Couple / Relationship Framework (CLRF / “Between Us”)

Influence:

- Conditions/needs language for relational dynamics.
- Emotional scope boundaries:
  - what is safe to handle in a structured conversation vs what requires deeper support.
- Focus on everyday cooperation rather than extreme crisis only.

Echoes in QSS:

- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs dimension.
- Explicit “scope and limits” section (what QSS is not for).
- Personal reflection playbooks (role decision, burnout, recurring conflict).

## Adjacent Practices and Disciplines

These are areas where QSS is **philosophically aligned** or structurally inspired, but not a direct implementation.

### Systems Thinking and Organizational Diagnostics

Influence:

- Seeing problems as patterns and feedback loops, not isolated events.
- Shifting focus from “who failed?” to “what system produces this outcome?”
- Using multiple “views” and layers (individual, team, org, ecosystem).

Echoes in QSS:

- Layering / Abstraction dimension.
- Causality & Consequence dimension (cause–effect chains).
- Recursion as a way for the system (not the individual) to learn.

### Coaching and Facilitation Practices

Influence:

- Coaching-style questioning:
  - curiosity,
  - non-judgment,
  - focus on client’s own insight.
- Workshop facilitation patterns:
  - check-ins,
  - retrospectives,
  - decision framing.

Echoes in QSS:

- Meta / Reflexive dimension:
  - checking “how is this conversation working?”
- Templates for:
  - entry questions,
  - exit/next-step questions.
- Emphasis on “one small step” instead of grand plans.

Important distinction:

- QSS borrows **structural** ideas (how to hold a conversation),
- but does **not** position itself as a coaching certification or therapy method.

### Conflict Resolution and Nonviolent Communication (NVC-like patterns)

Influence:

- Separating:
  - observations,
  - feelings,
  - needs,
  - and requests.
- Treating needs as universal and legitimate, even when strategies conflict.
- De-escalation through naming impact rather than blaming.

Echoes in QSS:

- Emotional & Relational Field / Needs dimension.
- Patterns that ask:
  - “How does this feel?”,
  - “Which needs are met/not met?”,
  - framed within current context.
- Stabilization-mode spaces that explicitly ask:
  - how collaboration feels,
  - and what would make it more workable.

Boundary:

- QSS keeps emotional work:
  - context-bound,
  - present/future-oriented,
  - and explicitly non-clinical.

### Agile / Lean / DevOps / Retro Practices

Influence:

- Iterative improvement and “inspect and adapt”.
- Retrospectives (what went well, what didn’t, what to change).
- Hypothesis and experiment framing:
  - treat change as testable bets.

Echoes in QSS:

- Recursion and iteration loops chapter.
- Evidence & Uncertainty dimension:
  - “what do we know vs assume?”
  - “what experiment could reduce uncertainty?”
- Growth-mode spaces for DevEx, delivery practice, and creative improvement.

### Strategy and Sensemaking Frameworks

Influence:

- Strategy as a pattern of choices under uncertainty.
- Mapping value chains and evolution (for example, Wardley Maps-style thinking in your broader work).
- Frameworks that separate:
  - context,
  - climate,
  - doctrine,
  - and gameplay.

Echoes in QSS:

- Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty, and Contrast & Alternatives working together as a strategic lens.
- Orientation as a “mini strategy statement” for each space.
- Domain playbooks that align question spaces with strategic outcomes (delivery models, creative direction).

QSS is not a strategy framework by itself, but it is **strategy-compatible**: it gives you a way to interrogate strategic choices.

### Critical Thinking and Rationalist Traditions

Influence:

- Making assumptions explicit.
- Separating belief from evidence.
- Thinking in “confidence levels” and update rules.

Echoes in QSS:

- Evidence & Uncertainty dimension:
  - “what do we actually know?”
  - “how could we be wrong?”
- Question patterns around experiments and falsification.
- Avoiding overconfident narratives, especially in high-stakes decisions.

## AI, Prompting, and Question Engineering

QSS is also informed by:

- your experience working with GPT-style systems as:
  - assistants,
  - co-writers,
  - and diagnostic agents (HCS GPT, 3SF GPT, future QSS GPT).
- observation that:
  - “the quality of answers is bounded by the quality of questions + context.”

Influence:

- Treating “question space” as a design artifact, not an accident.
- Thinking about:
  - Orientation,
  - Topology,
  - Flow,
  - Recursion,
  as the “system prompt” for human–human and human–AI dialogues alike.
- Using templates and checklists similar to prompt-engineering patterns:
  - explicit roles,
  - constraints,
  - modes.

Echoes in QSS:

- Structure of files (Theory → Practice → Reference) mirrors how you’ve built domain-specific GPTs.
- Emphasis on:
  - context intake,
  - explicit modes,
  - reusable patterns,
  in both human and AI-assisted workflows.

## Philosophical and Historical Echoes

These are not direct sources you systematically studied *for QSS*, but conceptual echoes worth naming.

### Socratic and Inquiry-Based Traditions

Influence:

- Using questions to surface hidden assumptions.
- Leading someone to see a contradiction or gap in their own reasoning.
- Emphasis on understanding “what is really meant” rather than just the first answer.

Echoes in QSS:

- Clarification and Assumptions dimensions working in tandem.
- Meta questions that ask:
  - “Have we named the real issue, or are we circling?”

### Dialogue and Deliberation Traditions

Influence:

- Structured dialogue aiming at mutual understanding, not just winning.
- Techniques that:
  - slow down reaction,
  - foreground listening.

Echoes in QSS:

- Multi-perspective entry questions:
  - “From your perspective, what is happening?”
- Domain playbooks that ask:
  - client, vendor, internal roles to describe their views before designing solutions.

## What QSS Explicitly Is Not

To avoid over-claiming or confusion, QSS is **not**:

- A therapy modality.
- A coaching school or certification.
- A replacement for:
  - legal advice,
  - medical or mental health care,
  - HR or safeguarding processes.
- A direct implementation of:
  - Nonviolent Communication,
  - Wardley Maps,
  - Cynefin,
  - any specific Agile scaling framework,
  - or any particular philosophical school.

It borrows **structural ideas** and **sensibilities**, not protocols.

When QSS touches issues that clearly belong to those domains, its intended behavior is to:

- recognize the boundary,
- not cross it,
- and suggest more appropriate forms of help.

## How to Extend This Sources List

You can expand this file as you:

- notice new influences (“this dimension feels like X”),
- read new material that sharpens your thinking,
- or want to credit specific authors or works.

Simple pattern for adding entries:

```markdown
### [Name of model / author / field]

Influence:

- …

Echoes in QSS:

- …

Boundary / distinction:

- what QSS does not claim or copy from this source.
```

You can also maintain a private version with:
	•	specific books, articles, talks, or courses,
	•	and any notes on “what I borrowed, what I changed, what I rejected”.

Why this matters

QSS is ultimately about honest inquiry.

Being transparent about its sources is part of that honesty:
	•	It keeps your work grounded and credit-aware.
	•	It helps others relate QSS to concepts they already know.
	•	It reminds you that this system is not magic:
	•	it’s your synthesis of things you’ve lived, studied, and tested.

This file exists so that as QSS grows, its roots stay visible.
