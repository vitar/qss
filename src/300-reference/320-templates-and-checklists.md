# Templates and Checklists

This file is your **“do it fast, don’t forget the essentials”** toolkit.

Use it when you want to:

- design a new question space quickly,
- sanity-check an existing one,
- capture outcomes and learning for later reuse.

You can copy–paste these into your own notes, tweak, and version.

Safety and Scope Checklist

Use this as a quick guardrail before and during any space.

[ ] Have I considered:

    - Risk of harm or self-harm?
    - Abuse, harassment, or discrimination?
    - Serious health issues (physical or mental)?
    - Legal conflict or liability?

If any are “yes / maybe”:

[ ] Am I avoiding:
    - framing this as something questions alone can resolve?
    - pushing for emotional disclosure beyond context and present?

[ ] Have I:

    - Acknowledged the weight of what appeared?
    - Suggested more appropriate support where needed?
      (manager, HR, doctor, therapist, lawyer, trusted person, etc.)

[ ] In this space, I commit to:

    - Staying within work/creative context.
    - Keeping Emotion & Needs tied to current collaboration or project.
    - Not interpreting clinical or legal matters.

[ ] If I feel out of depth:

    - I will slow down or stop.
    - I will not pretend that continuing with more questions is “help”.

“Build in 10 Minutes” Checklist

When you need a space quickly.

[ ] 1. Name it
    - “X for Y” (for example, “Setup for new client”, “Stabilization for Team A”, “Mix direction for live album”)

[ ] 2. One-sentence Orientation
    - In this [mode] situation, with [people/power],
      I want this space to help [goal] in a way that feels [relational tone].

[ ] 3. Choose 3–5 dimensions
    - Setup:
      - Clarification, Value, Assumptions, Boundaries, Evidence
    - Stabilization:
      - Clarification, Temporal, Emotion, Assumptions, Boundaries
    - Growth:
      - Value, Contrast, Temporal, Causality, Evidence

[ ] 4. Draft flow
    - Entry: 1 question
    - Segment 1: 2–3 questions
    - Segment 2: 3–4 questions
    - Exit: 2–3 questions (action + meta)

[ ] 5. Safety pass
    - Is anything here likely to:
      - expose someone with low power,
      - drift into therapy/medical/legal territory?
    - If yes, adjust or remove.

[ ] 6. Run, then note 3 things
    - 1 thing that helped
    - 1 thing that didn’t
    - 1 change for next time

You do not have to use every template.

Pick the smallest one that matches the moment,
and let your Question Space System grow by capturing what actually works for you.
