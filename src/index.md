# Question Space System (QSS)

The Question Space System is a **personal framework for designing structured inquiry**.

Instead of asking “What are the right questions?”, QSS helps you design the **whole space** around them:

- why you are asking,
- for whom,
- under which power and safety conditions,
- through which dimensions (clarification, assumptions, value, emotion, evidence, etc.),
- in what order,
- and how the space should learn from its own use.

You can use QSS for:

- client–vendor conversations in software delivery,
- internal leadership and team alignment,
- personal reflection and role decisions,
- creative work such as music production and band decisions.

QSS is:

- context-specific:
  - every question space is designed for a concrete situation.
- power-aware:
  - you always consider who has authority and who carries risk.
- emotionally scoped:
  - you acknowledge feelings and needs, but stay within work/creative/present context.
- recursive:
  - every run teaches you how to refine the space itself.

QSS is not:

- a therapy method,
- a coaching school,
- legal or medical advice,
- a generic “ask better questions” checklist.

It is a **working system** you adapt to your domains and style.

## How this site is organized

There are three main sections.

### Introduction and Quick Start

- A short guide to:
  - what QSS is,
  - when to use it,
  - and how to get started in 10–30 minutes.

Start here if you just want to try the system before reading theory.

### Theory

The Theory section explains the core ideas:

- what a question space is,
- orientation, topology, flow, recursion,
- dimensions of inquiry:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership,
  - Value & Impact,
  - Emotional & Relational Field / Needs,
  - Contrast & Alternatives,
  - Causality & Consequence,
  - Layering / Abstraction,
  - Temporal,
  - Evidence & Uncertainty,
  - Meta / Reflexive,
- modes and lifecycle:
  - Setup, Stabilization, Growth,
- patterns and anti-patterns.

You do not need to memorize all of this. It is here to give you **mental models** behind the practical tools.

### Practice

The Practice section is where you actually build and run spaces:

- Practical overview:
  - how to think in QSS while working.
- Quickstart builder:
  - build a usable space in minutes.
- Context intake and orientation:
  - safety, power, and the Safety Check rule.
- Designing topology and flow:
  - choosing dimensions and arranging them.
- Recursion and iteration:
  - how your spaces evolve with use.
- Domain playbooks:
  - software delivery and consulting,
  - personal reflection,
  - music production.

If you are in a hurry, you can start directly from Practice and return to Theory later.

### Reference

The Reference section is your toolkit and index:

- Glossary:
  - definitions of key terms.
- Question pattern cheatsheets:
  - ready-made question patterns by dimension and mode.
- Templates and checklists:
  - specs, intake, flow design, review notes.
- Example spaces and case studies:
  - worked examples from real-like scenarios.
- Sources:
  - inspirations and adjacent models.

You can treat Reference as your **“grab something and go”** area.

## How to approach QSS

You do not need to adopt everything at once.

You can:

- start small:
  - design one space for a real situation this week,
- reuse:
  - modify an existing space from the examples,
- grow:
  - add your own domains and question patterns.

Over time, QSS becomes your **personal library** of question spaces:

- tuned to your work,
- tuned to your relationships,
- and tuned to how you naturally think.

The rest of this section (Introduction & Quick Start) will show you how to use the system in different contexts without drowning in detail.
