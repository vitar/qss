# Dimensions of Inquiry

This chapter describes the **core dimensions of inquiry** used in QSS to shape the topology of a question space.

Each dimension is:

- A **lens** through which to look at a situation.
- A **functional cluster** of question patterns.
- A **design choice**: you select which dimensions to activate for a given context.

You rarely need all dimensions at once.  
The skill is choosing the right subset, at the right depth, for the problem and people in front of you.

For each dimension, this chapter outlines:

- What it is for.
- When to use it.
- Signs it is missing.
- Common question patterns.
- Typical pitfalls.

The dimensions covered here:

- Clarification
- Assumptions
- Boundaries & Ownership
- Value & Impact
- Contrast & Alternatives
- Causality & Consequence
- Layering / Abstraction
- Temporal
- Meta / Reflexive

## Clarification

Clarification questions ensure that **words, concepts, and situations mean the same thing** to the people involved.

### What it is for

- Aligning on terms (“done”, “MVP”, “secure”, “good enough”).
- Making implicit context explicit.
- Avoiding arguments driven by different mental pictures of “the same” thing.

### When to use it

- Early in any engagement, conversation, or reflection.
- When people agree on words but act as if they disagree.
- When you hear vague or overloaded terms (“enterprise-grade”, “strategic”, “quality”, “complex”).

### Signs it is missing

- Chronic “agreement” that repeatedly collapses during execution.
- Participants talk past each other despite using identical vocabulary.
- Decisions are “approved” but nobody behaves as if they truly understand them.

### Example question patterns

- “When you say *X*, what do you mean in concrete terms?”
- “Can you give an example of *X* from your context?”
- “What would ‘good enough’ look like here, specifically?”
- “How would we recognize *X* in a real situation?”

### Pitfalls

- Endless clarification without moving forward (“analysis paralysis”).
- Using clarification as a way to challenge or humiliate rather than understand.
- Over-specifying low-stakes terms while high-stakes concepts remain fuzzy.

## Assumptions

Assumption questions surface **what people take for granted** about reality, constraints, roles, and behavior.

### What it is for

- Making hidden expectations, beliefs, and constraints visible.
- Revealing mismatches in mental models.
- Testing whether the current plan rests on fragile or outdated assumptions.

### When to use it

- When things keep “unexpectedly” going wrong.
- When two sides seem genuinely surprised by each other’s behavior.
- During any planning, risk assessment, or strategy work.

### Signs it is missing

- Frequent phrases like “we thought you would…” or “I assumed they knew…”.
- Strong emotional reactions to “obvious” facts that were never actually shared.
- Plans that look good on paper but collapse in contact with reality.

### Example question patterns

- “What are we assuming about how X will behave?”
- “What are you expecting us/them to do without saying it explicitly?”
- “What constraints are we treating as fixed? Which of those might be negotiable?”
- “If this plan fails, which assumption do you think will be the culprit?”

### Pitfalls

- Turning assumption exploration into blame (“You assumed wrong”).
- Assuming that once named, assumptions are automatically resolved.
- Surfacing too many assumptions at once without prioritizing which ones matter.

## Boundaries & Ownership

Boundary questions define **what is inside or outside the system**, and **who holds responsibility or authority** over different parts.

### What it is for

- Clarifying scope: what this space, project, or decision covers (and does not).
- Clarifying ownership: who decides, who executes, who is accountable.
- Reducing friction caused by role confusion and vague responsibilities.

### When to use it

- In cross-team or cross-organization work (e.g., client–vendor).
- When tasks fall “between chairs”.
- When people assume someone else is taking care of something important.

### Signs it is missing

- Repeated handoff failures.
- Frequent sentences like “I thought you owned that” or “That’s not my job”.
- Decisions being made by people who are not accountable for their consequences.

### Example question patterns

- “Which parts of this are clearly inside our scope, and which are not?”
- “Who has final say on X? Who needs to be consulted?”
- “Where exactly is the handoff between team A and team B?”
- “What is clearly not our responsibility here, even if it affects us?”

### Pitfalls

- Using boundaries as walls instead of clarity (rigid territorial behavior).
- Over-assigning ownership without confirming capacity or willingness.
- Avoiding shared ownership when the situation genuinely requires it.

## Value & Impact

Value & Impact questions focus on **who benefits or suffers** from outcomes, and **what matters most** to them.

### What it is for

- Connecting decisions to real human and system consequences.
- Prioritizing when trade-offs are unavoidable.
- Aligning on what “success” and “failure” really mean.

### When to use it

- When different parties pull in different directions.
- When priorities are unclear or constantly shifting.
- Whenever a decision could have large downstream effects on people, customers, or systems.

### Signs it is missing

- Teams optimize for local metrics while global outcomes suffer.
- Decisions are made based on habit, ego, or convenience rather than impact.
- People feel like they “hit the target but missed the point”.

### Example question patterns

- “Who will feel the impact of this choice first? How?”
- “What outcome would make you call this a success? A failure?”
- “If we can only satisfy one of these stakeholders fully, who is it and why?”
- “What kind of harm are we explicitly willing or not willing to tolerate here?”

### Pitfalls

- Reducing value to only financial or only emotional dimensions.
- Treating all stakeholders as equally important when they clearly are not.
- Over-focusing on immediate impact and ignoring longer-term consequences.

## Contrast & Alternatives

Contrast questions explore **what something is by juxtaposing it with what it is not**, and consider **alternative paths**.

### What it is for

- Making choices and trade-offs explicit.
- Breaking out of binary thinking (“this or nothing”).
- Seeing the current path as one option among many.

### When to use it

- When the conversation feels stuck in a single framing.
- When someone is heavily attached to “the only way” to do something.
- During design, strategy, or creative decisions.

### Signs it is missing

- People talk as if there is no alternative to the current plan.
- Cynicism: “We already tried everything.”
- Dogmatism: “This is how it must be done.”

### Example question patterns

- “What is the opposite of what we’re proposing, and what would that look like?”
- “If we had to take a radically different approach, what might it be?”
- “What’s the ‘do nothing’ alternative here? What happens if we choose it?”
- “What would a minimal version of this look like? What would a maximal version look like?”

### Pitfalls

- Generating infinite alternatives without ever choosing.
- Using contrast only to attack other perspectives, not to understand them.
- Over-romanticizing unconventional options just because they are different.

## Causality & Consequence

Causality & Consequence questions explore **why things are the way they are** and **what is likely to happen next**.

### What it is for

- Understanding root causes of problems.
- Anticipating downstream effects of decisions.
- Mapping chains of influence in systems (technical, social, organizational).

### When to use it

- When patterns repeat and nobody understands why.
- When an intervention has unexpected side effects.
- When planning significant changes or resets.

### Signs it is missing

- Explanations focus on symptoms, not mechanisms.
- “Whack-a-mole” problem solving: fixing issues that immediately reappear elsewhere.
- Decisions are made as if there were no knock-on effects.

### Example question patterns

- “What events or conditions led us here?”
- “If we change X, what else will be affected as a result?”
- “What is the most plausible chain of events if we keep doing what we do today?”
- “What is the most likely reason this keeps happening?”

### Pitfalls

- Pretending to know exact causality in complex systems (overconfidence).
- Using causal stories to assign blame instead of learning.
- Getting stuck in past analysis without moving toward future-oriented choices.

## Layering / Abstraction

Layering questions move between **different levels of abstraction**: from concrete details to high-level patterns, and back.

### What it is for

- Avoiding getting lost in details without understanding the bigger picture.
- Avoiding vague strategy talk that never touches reality.
- Connecting individual experiences to system-level structures.

### When to use it

- When conversations oscillate between “too abstract” and “too detailed”.
- When people disagree on whether a problem is “local” or systemic.
- When you want to relate individual stories to patterns and vice versa.

### Signs it is missing

- Strategy discussions feel disconnected from everyday work.
- Local fixes never change systemic behavior.
- People argue about details without agreeing what they are trying to achieve.

### Example question patterns

- “If we zoom out one level, how would you describe this problem?”
- “What is an example of this, at the most concrete level you can think of?”
- “If this is a symptom, what bigger pattern might it belong to?”
- “How would this look different if we solved it at the system level instead of the individual level?”

### Pitfalls

- Staying at a comfortable level (only abstract, only concrete) and refusing to move.
- Using abstraction to avoid responsibility (“the system is the problem”) without specifying mechanisms.
- Using details to dismiss systemic patterns (“this is just a one-off”).

## Temporal (Past–Present–Future)

Temporal questions explore **how things change over time**: what led here, what is true now, and what could or should happen next.

### What it is for

- Understanding trajectories, not just snapshots.
- Distinguishing between legacy constraints and current choices.
- Designing realistic future scenarios or transitions.

### When to use it

- When history heavily influences current dynamics.
- When people feel stuck or believe “it’s always been like this.”
- When planning change or evaluating risk over time.

### Signs it is missing

- Over-focus on the current crisis without understanding how it developed.
- Romanticizing or demonizing the past without specifics.
- Future plans that ignore realistic timeframes and inertia.

### Example question patterns

- “How did we get from there to here? What were the key turning points?”
- “What is undeniably true about the present situation?”
- “If nothing changes, where are we in six months? Two years?”
- “What would we like to be true in three years that is not true now?”

### Pitfalls

- Over-analyzing the past as if it could be changed.
- Making overconfident predictions about the future.
- Ignoring the present in favor of nostalgic or speculative narratives.

## Meta / Reflexive

Meta questions reflect on **the inquiry itself**: how we are thinking, what we are missing, and how the space feels.

### What it is for

- Keeping the question space humane and adaptive.
- Noticing when the current framing isn’t working.
- Integrating learning back into Orientation, Topology, and Flow.

### When to use it

- At the end of a round of questions.
- When the conversation feels stuck, tense, or strangely flat.
- When new information radically changes the situation.

### Signs it is missing

- People feel “processed” rather than engaged.
- The same patterns of questioning are repeated without evolving.
- Nobody ever asks whether the conversation itself is helping.

### Example question patterns

- “What became clearer after these questions?”
- “What feels more confusing or unsettled now?”
- “Which important perspective or topic have we not touched yet?”
- “Are we still asking the right questions for our original intent?”

### Pitfalls

- Using meta-level talk to avoid ever engaging with the concrete situation.
- Turning meta reflection into self-criticism or blame.
- Overloading people with self-awareness when they need simple next steps.

## Using Dimensions in Practice

You generally do not design question spaces by “using all dimensions at once.”  
Instead, you:

- Clarify **Orientation**.
- Select a **subset of dimensions** that match the situation.
- Design a **Flow** through those dimensions.
- Use **Meta / Reflexive** questions to adjust as you go.

Examples of dimension selections:

- Early client–vendor alignment:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact, Causality & Consequence.
- Internal team conflict:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact, Meta.
- Personal career reflection:
  - Value & Impact, Temporal, Layering, Meta.
- Creative direction for a recording:
  - Contrast & Alternatives, Value & Impact, Causality & Consequence, Layering.

The next chapter, on **Modes and Lifecycle**, will show how these dimensions behave differently in Setup, Stabilization, and Growth modes of a question space.
