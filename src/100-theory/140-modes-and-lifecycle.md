# Modes and Lifecycle

Question spaces are not static templates.  
They move through **modes** and have a **lifecycle** that reflects how they are created, used, and evolved.

QSS distinguishes three primary modes and one optional closure mode:

- Setup Mode
- Stabilization Mode
- Growth Mode
- Reset / Archive Mode (optional)

These modes apply both to:

- A specific question space instance (for one situation or session).
- A reusable question space pattern (used across many situations).

Understanding modes helps you design, use, and refine question spaces in a way that matches reality instead of forcing everything into a single “one-size-fits-all” pattern.

## Modes Overview

At a high level:

- **Setup Mode** – design and initial use of a question space to get from “nothing structured” to “usable clarity”.
- **Stabilization Mode** – use the space to repair confusion, conflict, or drift.
- **Growth Mode** – use the space to deepen, extend, or generalize understanding.
- **Reset / Archive Mode** – close, version, or retire a space when its context has changed.

A single conversation can move through more than one mode.  
A mature reusable space often passes through all of them over time.

## Setup Mode

Setup Mode is about **bringing a question space into existence** for a specific context.

### Purpose

- Move from unstructured talk or vague intention to a **deliberate space of inquiry**.
- Make Orientation explicit.
- Select a minimal, appropriate Topology for the situation.
- Sketch a humane Flow that people can actually walk through.

Setup is not about perfection. It is about creating **minimal sufficient structure** to start.

### Typical activities

In Setup Mode you:

- Clarify Orientation:
  - “What are we trying to understand or change?”
  - “For whom does this matter?”
- Choose a subset of dimensions (Topology):
  - For example: Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries, Value & Impact for a project kickoff.
- Draft a simple Flow:
  - Start with context and Clarification.
  - Move to Assumptions and Boundaries.
  - Close with Value & Impact and one Meta question.
- Optionally write a lightweight artifact:
  - A one-page structure with clusters of question patterns.

### When to stay shallow

Not every Setup requires deep design work. For small or low-stakes situations:

- One or two sentences for Orientation.
- Three to five key questions across one or two dimensions.
- One closing Meta question.

This is still a question space, just a small one.

### Example

Scenario: new client–vendor engagement.

Setup Mode might produce:

- Orientation:
  - “Help client and vendor align on problem, constraints, roles, and success criteria before detailed planning.”
- Dimensions:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact.
- Flow:
  - Context and Clarification → Assumptions → Boundaries & Ownership → Value & Impact → Meta.

This can be captured as a simple structured outline used in a first workshop.

## Stabilization Mode

Stabilization Mode is about **using a question space to repair confusion, conflict, or drift**.

A setup may have existed or not; the key is that the system is now unstable or misaligned, and the space is used to regain footing.

### Purpose

- Identify where understanding has diverged.
- Surface hidden assumptions and conflicting interpretations.
- Re-anchor Orientation if needed (“what are we really trying to achieve?”).
- Reduce emotional friction by creating a safe structure for dialogue.

### Typical activities

In Stabilization Mode you:

- Start with a short recap:
  - “What has happened so far?”
- Use Clarification and Assumptions heavily:
  - “What did each party think was happening?”
- Use Boundaries & Ownership:
  - “Who believed they owned which decisions and actions?”
- Revisit Value & Impact:
  - “What is at risk if we continue like this?”
- Add explicit Meta questions:
  - “What did we discover about how we communicate?”

It often makes sense to temporarily simplify the topology here, focusing on dimensions that reduce immediate friction.

### When to switch to Stabilization

Signals that it is time to use or design a question space in Stabilization Mode:

- Repeating conflicts or escalations.
- People reporting “we keep having the same conversation”.
- Emotionally loaded discussions with no productive movement.

### Example

Scenario: project timeline slipping, mutual frustration between client and vendor.

Stabilization Mode might:

- Use an adapted version of the original setup space.
- Emphasize:
  - Clarification (what each side believes is the current state).
  - Assumptions (what each side thought the other would do).
  - Boundaries & Ownership (who owns which decisions).
  - Value & Impact (what both sides care about preserving).
- Conclude with a small set of agreed next steps and a refreshed Orientation.

## Growth Mode

Growth Mode is about **deepening and extending understanding** once basic stability exists.

The conversation is no longer about preventing failure but about **exploring potential**.

### Purpose

- Expand the space into new dimensions (for example, strategy, innovation, long-term consequences).
- Refine the question space into a more general pattern or reusable template.
- Explore “next horizon” questions that were too early or too risky during Setup or Stabilization.

### Typical activities

In Growth Mode you:

- Add or reweight dimensions:
  - Introduce Contrast & Alternatives to explore different strategic paths.
  - Use Layering to connect local decisions to organizational patterns.
  - Use Temporal to think in longer horizons.
- Experiment with new Flow patterns:
  - Move from short, linear flows to branching paths or modular segments.
- Capture and generalize:
  - Turn successful flows into documented playbooks or templates.
  - Note common pitfalls and refine Meta questions.

### When Growth Mode makes sense

Signals:

- Basic alignment and trust are present.
- People are asking “what else is possible?” rather than “how do we stop this from breaking?”
- The same question space has been used multiple times and appears robust.

### Example

Scenario: a question space originally built for diagnosing client–vendor misalignment proves effective.

Growth Mode might:

- Add a strategic dimension:
  - Contrast & Alternatives for different engagement models.
- Introduce a long-term Temporal segment:
  - “Where do we want this relationship to be in one year, three years?”
- Turn the space into a reusable internal “Engagement Alignment” playbook, with example scripts and variations.

## Reset / Archive Mode

Reset / Archive Mode is an optional mode for when a question space:

- No longer matches its context, or
- Has served its purpose and needs closure.

### Purpose

- Avoid forcing an outdated space onto new realities.
- Preserve learning by versioning rather than discarding.
- Create psychological and structural closure when needed.

### Typical activities

In Reset / Archive Mode you:

- Ask Meta questions:
  - “What did this question space help us see consistently?”
  - “Where did it fail or mislead us?”
  - “Which assumptions baked into this space are no longer valid?”
- Decide on action:
  - Reset: design a new Setup with updated Orientation and Topology.
  - Archive: keep the space as a v1 pattern for reference but not active use.
  - Split: separate a complex space into two simpler, more focused ones.

### Example

Scenario: a question space used for “remote collaboration alignment” before a major organizational shift (new tools, policies, and culture changes) no longer fits well.

Reset / Archive Mode might:

- Capture what it did well (for example, surfacing communication preferences).
- Note where it now feels misaligned (for example, assumptions about tools).
- Create a new Setup for “hybrid collaboration alignment” while archiving the old space as v1.

## Lifecycle of a Question Space

Over time, a reusable question space often moves through a lifecycle like this:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Designed for a specific situation.
   - Tested in one or a few conversations.

2. **Early Stabilization Use**
   - Applied when tensions or misunderstandings appear.
   - Adjusted based on what actually happens in practice.

3. **Maturing Growth**
   - Recognized as broadly useful.
   - Extended into a pattern or playbook.
   - Adapted to multiple domains or contexts.

4. **Reset or Archive**
   - Updated when its assumptions no longer match reality.
   - Split into variations (for example, light vs deep versions).
   - Archived as a historical version if no longer fit for active use.

This lifecycle can run at different scales:

- For a single project.
- For an internal practice (for example, consulting discovery calls).
- For a personal reflection routine.

## Using Modes in Design and Practice

When designing or using question spaces, you can explicitly ask:

- “Which mode am I in right now?”
- “Is this a Setup situation, a Stabilization situation, or a Growth situation?”
- “Does the space I’m using match the mode we’re actually in?”

If there is a mismatch:

- Using a Growth-style space in a Stabilization crisis may feel insensitive or overwhelming.
- Using only Stabilization-style questioning in a Growth context may feel limiting or pessimistic.
- Using Setup-style questions when deep conflict is already present may feel naive.

Designing with modes in mind helps you:

- Choose dimensions accordingly.
- Shape Flow to the emotional and cognitive state of the people involved.
- Decide how much recursion and meta-reflection is appropriate.

The next chapters in QSS will show how to apply this architecture and these modes in concrete practice, and how to construct question spaces step by step for different domains.
