# Modes and Lifecycle

Question spaces are not static templates.  
They move through **modes** and have a **lifecycle** that reflects how they are created, used, and evolved.

QSS distinguishes three primary modes and one optional closure mode:

- Setup Mode
- Stabilization Mode
- Growth Mode
- Reset / Archive Mode (optional)

These modes apply both to:

- A specific question space instance (for one situation or session).
- A reusable question space pattern (used across many situations).

Understanding modes helps you design, use, and refine question spaces in a way that matches reality instead of forcing everything into a single “one-size-fits-all” pattern.

## Modes Overview

At a high level:

- **Setup Mode**  
  Design and initial use of a question space to get from “nothing structured” to “usable clarity”.  
  Safety, power, and limits are considered explicitly here.

- **Stabilization Mode**  
  Use the space to repair confusion, conflict, or drift.  
  Emotional and relational dynamics are often front and center.

- **Growth Mode**  
  Use the space to deepen, extend, or generalize understanding.  
  Evidence & Uncertainty, Layering, and Contrast are often more prominent.

- **Reset / Archive Mode**  
  Close, version, or retire a space when its context has changed or when its assumptions are no longer acceptable.

A single conversation can move through more than one mode.  
A mature reusable space often passes through all of them over time.

## Setup Mode

Setup Mode is about **bringing a question space into existence** for a specific context.

### Purpose

- Move from unstructured talk or vague intention to a **deliberate space of inquiry**.
- Make Orientation explicit, including:
  - cognitive goals (what we want to understand),
  - emotional/relational goals (how we want this to feel),
  - and basic power awareness (who holds authority and risk).
- Select a minimal, appropriate Topology for the situation.
- Sketch a humane Flow that people can actually walk through without overload.

Setup is not about perfection. It is about creating **minimal sufficient structure** to start.

### Typical activities

In Setup Mode you:

- Clarify Orientation:
  - “What are we trying to understand or change?”
  - “For whom does this matter, and how?”
  - “How do we want this conversation to feel (for example, safe, direct, exploratory)?”
- Notice power and stakes:
  - “Who has formal authority here?”
  - “Whose job or evaluation might be affected by this?”
- Choose a subset of dimensions (Topology), such as:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact.
  - Emotion & Needs if there is visible tension or history.
  - Evidence & Uncertainty if decisions hinge on disputed facts or estimates.
- Draft a simple Flow:
  - Start with context and Clarification.
  - Move through a few key dimensions (for example, Assumptions → Boundaries → Value).
  - Close with one or two Meta questions.

### Safety and limits in Setup

Setup is also the place to check whether **QSS is appropriate at all**:

- If there are signs of acute crisis, self-harm risk, or immediate danger,  
  a structured question space is not the primary tool.
- If the situation is primarily legal or medical,  
  QSS can help with reflection, but not with formal decisions.

A simple internal check:

- “Is this a situation where thoughtful conversation can realistically help right now?”  
  If the honest answer is “no”, the responsible move is to pause and redirect.

### Example

Scenario: new client–vendor engagement.

Setup Mode might produce:

- Orientation:
  - “Help client and vendor align on the problem, constraints, roles, and success criteria before detailed planning, in a way that feels transparent and fair.”
- Dimensions:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries & Ownership, Value & Impact, Evidence & Uncertainty.
- Flow:
  - Context and Clarification → Assumptions → Boundaries & Ownership → Value & Impact → Evidence & Uncertainty → Meta (“what feels clear / unclear now?”).

This can be captured as a simple structured outline used in a first workshop.

## Stabilization Mode

Stabilization Mode is about **using a question space to repair confusion, conflict, or drift**.

A setup may have existed or not; the key is that the system is now unstable or misaligned, and the space is used to regain footing.

### Purpose

- Identify where understanding has diverged.
- Surface hidden assumptions and conflicting interpretations.
- Re-anchor Orientation if needed (“what are we really trying to achieve?”).
- Reduce emotional friction by creating a safe structure for dialogue.
- Be realistic about power: avoid interrogation from the top and shaming from any side.

### Typical activities

In Stabilization Mode you:

- Start with a brief recap:
  - “What has happened so far, from each key perspective?”
- Use Clarification and Assumptions heavily:
  - “What did each party think was happening?”
  - “What did you expect from the other side that was never said?”
- Use Boundaries & Ownership:
  - “Who believed they owned which decisions and actions?”
- Bring in Emotional & Relational Field / Needs:
  - “Is there anything about how this unfolded that is still emotionally charged or draining?”
  - “What needs to change for this to feel workable again?”
- Revisit Value & Impact:
  - “What is at risk if we continue like this?”
- Use Evidence & Uncertainty to separate:
  - “What actually happened?” from “How did it feel?” and from “What do we assume?”
- Add explicit Meta questions:
  - “What did we discover about how we communicate and decide?”

It often makes sense to temporarily simplify the topology, focusing on dimensions that reduce immediate friction and misunderstanding.

### Power-aware Stabilization

Because tensions are higher here, power dynamics matter even more:

- A manager using Stabilization Mode with their team should:
  - Avoid interrogation disguised as “clarification”.
  - Own their part of assumptions and boundaries.
- A vendor stabilizing with a client should:
  - Make Orientation explicit (“we are not here to defend ourselves, but to understand what broke”).
  - Invite the client’s perspective first, then share their own, not the other way around.

### Example

Scenario: project timeline slipping, mutual frustration between client and vendor.

Stabilization Mode might:

- Use an adapted version of the original setup space.
- Emphasize:
  - Clarification (what each side believes is the current state).
  - Assumptions (what each side thought the other would do).
  - Boundaries & Ownership (who owns which decisions).
  - Emotional & Relational Field / Needs (how this situation now feels, what trust needs).
  - Value & Impact (what both sides care about preserving).
  - Evidence & Uncertainty (what is known versus story).
- Conclude with:
  - A small set of agreed next steps.
  - A refreshed Orientation for the next phase.

## Growth Mode

Growth Mode is about **deepening and extending understanding** once basic stability exists.

The conversation is no longer about preventing failure but about **exploring potential** and **improving the system**.

### Purpose

- Expand the space into new dimensions (for example, strategy, innovation, long-term consequences).
- Refine the question space into a more general pattern or reusable template.
- Explore “next horizon” questions that were too early or too risky during Setup or Stabilization.

### Typical activities

In Growth Mode you:

- Add or reweight dimensions:
  - Introduce Contrast & Alternatives to explore different strategic paths.
  - Use Layering to connect local decisions to organizational patterns.
  - Use Temporal to think in longer horizons (one to three years).
  - Use Evidence & Uncertainty more deliberately to decide where to experiment or measure.
- Deepen Emotional & Relational Field / Needs:
  - “How do we want this partnership / team / practice to feel when it is at its best?”
  - “What kind of culture are we building through these decisions?”
- Experiment with new Flow patterns:
  - Move from short, linear flows to branching paths or modular segments.
  - For example, a common trunk followed by optional “branches” depending on what emerges.
- Capture and generalize:
  - Turn successful flows into documented playbooks or templates.
  - Note common pitfalls and refine Meta questions.

### When Growth Mode makes sense

Signals:

- Basic alignment and trust are present.
- People are asking “what else is possible?” rather than “how do we stop this from breaking?”
- The same question space has been used multiple times and appears robust.
- There is appetite to invest time in improvement, not only damage control.

### Example

Scenario: a question space originally built for diagnosing client–vendor misalignment proves effective.

Growth Mode might:

- Add a strategic dimension:
  - Contrast & Alternatives for different engagement models (for example, fixed-bid vs capacity vs joint venture).
- Introduce a long-term Temporal segment:
  - “Where do we want this relationship to be in one year, in three years?”
- Use Evidence & Uncertainty:
  - “What do we actually know about what makes this relationship successful? What do we only believe?”
- Turn the space into a reusable internal “Engagement Alignment” playbook, with:
  - example scripts,
  - recommended flows per mode,
  - and notes on typical emotional and power patterns.

## Reset / Archive Mode

Reset / Archive Mode is an optional mode for when a question space:

- No longer matches its context, or
- Has served its purpose and needs closure.

### Purpose

- Avoid forcing an outdated space onto new realities.
- Preserve learning by versioning rather than discarding.
- Create psychological and structural closure when needed.

### Typical activities

In Reset / Archive Mode you:

- Ask Meta questions about the space itself:
  - “What did this question space consistently help us see?”
  - “Where did it fail or mislead us?”
  - “Which assumptions baked into this space are no longer valid (for example, about power, tools, culture, or market)?”
- Look at evidence:
  - “In which situations did this space produce good outcomes?”
  - “In which situations did it correlate with bad or neutral outcomes?”
- Decide on action:
  - Reset:
    - Design a new Setup with updated Orientation and Topology.
  - Archive:
    - Keep the space as a v1 pattern for reference but not active use.
  - Split:
    - Separate a complex space into two simpler, more focused ones.

### Example

Scenario: a question space used for “remote collaboration alignment” before a major organizational shift (new tools, hybrid work, cultural change) no longer fits well.

Reset / Archive Mode might:

- Capture what it did well (for example, surfacing communication preferences and overlap times).
- Note where it now feels misaligned (for example, assumptions about everyone being remote, or about who controls scheduling).
- Create a new Setup for “hybrid collaboration alignment” that:
  - reflects new tools and policies,
  - acknowledges new power dynamics (for example, on-site vs remote),
  - and incorporates updated Evidence & Uncertainty about what works.

## Lifecycle of a Question Space

Over time, a reusable question space often moves through a lifecycle like this:

1. **Initial Setup**  
   - Designed for a specific situation.  
   - Tested in one or a few conversations.  
   - Power, safety, and scope considered, even if briefly.

2. **Early Stabilization Use**  
   - Applied when tensions or misunderstandings appear.  
   - Adjusted based on what actually happens in practice.  
   - Emotional and relational patterns made more explicit.

3. **Maturing Growth**  
   - Recognized as broadly useful.  
   - Extended into a pattern or playbook.  
   - Adapted to multiple domains or contexts.  
   - Evidence & Uncertainty used to see where it really helps.

4. **Reset or Archive**  
   - Updated when its assumptions no longer match reality (for example, org structure, market conditions, culture).  
   - Split into variations (for example, light vs deep, internal vs external).  
   - Archived as a historical version if no longer fit for active use.

This lifecycle can run at different scales:

- For a single project.
- For an internal practice (for example, consulting discovery calls).
- For a personal reflection routine.

## Using Modes in Design and Practice

When designing or using question spaces, you can explicitly ask:

- “Which mode am I in right now?”
- “Is this a Setup situation, a Stabilization situation, or a Growth situation?”
- “Does the space I’m using match the mode we’re actually in?”

If there is a mismatch:

- Using a Growth-style space in a Stabilization crisis may feel insensitive, overwhelming, or tone-deaf.
- Using only Stabilization-style questioning in a Growth context may feel limiting or pessimistic.
- Using Setup-style questions when deep conflict is already present may feel naive and unsafe.

Designing with modes in mind helps you:

- Choose dimensions accordingly:
  - more Emotion & Needs and Boundaries in Stabilization,  
  - more Contrast, Temporal, and Evidence & Uncertainty in Growth.
- Shape Flow to the emotional and cognitive state of the people involved.
- Decide how much Meta reflection is appropriate without causing meta overload.

Modes and lifecycle give QSS its **dynamic behavior**: they keep question spaces responsive to real conditions instead of frozen as theoretical artifacts.
