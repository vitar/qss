# Core Architecture: Orientation, Topology, Flow, Recursion

This chapter describes the **core architecture** of a Question Space in QSS.

Every question space, regardless of domain, can be understood as four interacting layers:

- **Orientation** – Why we are asking.
- **Topology** – What dimensions of inquiry we activate.
- **Flow** – How we move through those dimensions.
- **Recursion** – How the space learns and corrects itself.

You can think of it as:

> Orientation sets the intent →  
> Topology shapes the landscape →  
> Flow guides the journey →  
> Recursion improves the map while you travel.

The rest of QSS builds on this structure.

## Orientation

**Orientation** is the layer that defines *why* the question space exists at all.

Without Orientation, questions become either random or manipulative. With Orientation, the space can be evaluated and adjusted against a clear purpose.

### Purpose of Orientation

Orientation:

- Clarifies what we are trying to understand or change.
- Connects inquiry to **human and system consequences**.
- Makes the space accountable to a concrete intent.

Typical intentions include:

- Diagnose misalignment.
- Explore options and trade-offs.
- Clarify values and priorities.
- Design a transition or reset.
- Reflect on experience and learn.

### Core Orientation Questions

Before designing any question space, QSS encourages answering questions such as:

- What situation is this space for?
- What decision, change, or understanding do we want to enable?
- For whom does this matter most?
- What kinds of consequences are we trying to influence or avoid?
- What is explicitly *out of scope* for this space?

These do not need to be long. A few sharp sentences are usually enough.

### Orientation Examples

Client–Vendor engagement:
- “Enable both sides to see where expectations, constraints, and success criteria differ, so we can adjust the engagement before it fails.”

Personal role reflection:
- “Understand whether moving into a hybrid leadership role is aligned with my values, energy, and desired impact over the next five years.”

Creative decision (mix direction):
- “Clarify the trade-offs between ‘hi-fi precision’ and ‘live energy’ for this recording, and choose a direction that best serves the music and its audience.”

In practice, Orientation is often captured as a short paragraph at the top of a question space artifact.

## Topology

**Topology** describes the **shape of the space**: which dimensions of inquiry are present and how they relate.

Instead of a flat, undifferentiated list of questions, a question space is structured around **dimensions** such as:

- Clarification
- Assumptions
- Boundaries & Ownership
- Value & Impact
- Contrast & Alternatives
- Causality & Consequence
- Layering / Abstraction
- Temporal (past–present–future)
- Meta / Reflexive

These are detailed in the next chapter. Here, we focus on how they work together as a topology.

### Purpose of Topology

Topology:

- Ensures that inquiry covers **relevant dimensions**, not just the loudest or most comfortable ones.
- Reduces the chance of blind spots (for example, talking only about features and never about consequences).
- Makes it easier to adapt and reuse spaces by swapping or reweighting dimensions.

### Selecting Dimensions

A question space rarely uses all possible dimensions. Instead, it deliberately chooses a subset based on:

- The **nature of the situation** (diagnosis, strategy, reflection, creative choice).
- The **main risks** (misalignment, hidden constraints, emotional overload, unclear impact).
- The **time available** (quick scan vs deep exploration).

Examples:

- For early project misalignment:
  - Clarification, Assumptions, Boundaries, Value & Impact, Causality & Consequence.
- For personal reflection:
  - Value & Impact, Temporal, Layering, Meta.
- For creative direction:
  - Contrast & Alternatives, Value & Impact, Layering, Causality & Consequence.

### Multi-Perspective Topology

Topology can also carry **perspectives** explicitly:

- Client vs Vendor vs End User.
- Individual vs Team vs Organization.
- Artist vs Audience vs Market.

For example, the same dimension (Value & Impact) can be explored from multiple perspectives:

- “What does success look like for the client?”  
- “What does success look like for the vendor?”  
- “What does success look like for end users?”

Good topology design makes it easy to see where perspectives align and where they diverge.

## Flow

**Flow** defines **how we travel** through the topology.

A question space is not just a set of dimensions; it also provides a sensible **pathway**:

- Where to start.
- What to explore first.
- When to deepen.
- When to switch dimensions.
- How to land on usable clarity.

### Purpose of Flow

Flow:

- Prevents the conversation from becoming chaotic or exhausting.
- Matches the **cognitive/emotional load** of participants.
- Creates a sense of progress: “We moved from confusion to some kind of shared understanding.”

Flow does not have to be rigidly linear, but it should be **legible**.

### Typical Flow Patterns

Some common patterns QSS recognizes:

- **Context → Clarification → Boundaries → Value & Impact → Consequences → Meta**  
  Useful for project kickoffs and alignment sessions.

- **Situation recap → Assumptions → Boundaries → Causality & Consequence → Trade-offs → Next steps**  
  Useful for conflict or escalation.

- **Future vision → Value & Impact → Contrast with present → Causality → Experiments / options → Meta reflection**  
  Useful for strategy or visioning conversations.

- **Past → Present → Future**  
  Combined with Value & Impact and Meta, useful for personal reflection.

### Depth Management

Flow can also be designed at multiple depths:

- **Shallow pass**: one or two questions per dimension, to get quick shared picture.
- **Deep dive**: more detailed questions within a single critical dimension (for example, assumptions or consequences).

A well-designed flow makes it possible to stop after a shallow pass if time or energy is limited, without collapsing the whole space.

## Recursion

**Recursion** is the self-correcting layer of a question space.

It introduces **meta-questions** and **revision moves** that allow the space to evolve in response to what is discovered.

### Purpose of Recursion

Recursion:

- Prevents the space from becoming rigid or dogmatic.
- Ensures that unexpected insights are integrated back into the structure.
- Allows reuse: question spaces can be refined across multiple uses.

In practice, recursion is what turns a question space from a static template into a **living tool**.

### Meta-Questions

Recursion is often implemented through short, simple meta-questions, such as:

- What became clearer after this round of questions?
- What feels more confusing or unsettled now?
- Which perspectives did we not hear or explore?
- Which dimension did we overuse? Which dimension did we ignore?
- Did we drift away from our original Orientation? Should we adjust it?

These can be asked:

- After a specific dimension.
- At the end of a flow.
- When the conversation feels stuck or emotionally loaded.

### Structural Adjustments

Recursion can also change the **structure** of the question space:

- Updating Orientation if the real problem turns out to be different.
- Adding or removing dimensions in the topology.
- Reordering flow to reflect what actually works better.
- Splitting a complex space into two simpler ones.

Example:

- You design a question space for “project risk diagnosis”.
- In practice, you notice that people get defensive in the Assumptions segment.
- Recursion: you insert a short Values & Impact segment before Assumptions to establish shared goals and reduce defensiveness.

Over time, this turns into a **new version** of the question space that is more humane and effective.

## How the Layers Work Together

The four layers are not steps; they are **aspects** of the same artifact.

A simple way to keep them in mind:

- **Orientation** – Are we clear on why this space exists?
- **Topology** – Have we chosen the right dimensions and perspectives?
- **Flow** – Is there a humane, understandable way to move through them?
- **Recursion** – Do we have mechanisms to notice and correct misfits?

When designing or evaluating a question space, you can use these as a quick checklist:

- If conversations feel aimless → Orientation is weak.
- If blind spots keep appearing → Topology is incomplete or unbalanced.
- If people feel overwhelmed or lost → Flow needs adjustment.
- If the space never improves across uses → Recursion is missing.
